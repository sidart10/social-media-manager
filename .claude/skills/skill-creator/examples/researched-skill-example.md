# Creating Product Descriptions

Generate high-converting product descriptions using proven copywriting frameworks.

## When to Use This Skill

Use when:
- Writing e-commerce product descriptions
- Creating catalog copy
- Optimizing product pages for conversion
- Need benefit-focused selling copy

## Three Proven Frameworks

### 1. AIDA (Attention ‚Üí Interest ‚Üí Desire ‚Üí Action)

**Researched from:** Copyblogger, multiple marketing sources

**Structure:**
- **Attention**: Bold opening, hook reader
- **Interest**: Highlight key benefit
- **Desire**: Paint picture of transformation
- **Action**: Clear CTA

**Use when:** High-consideration products, need strong hook

### 2. PAS (Problem ‚Üí Agitate ‚Üí Solution)

**Researched from:** Copywriting experts, conversion optimization guides

**Structure:**
- **Problem**: Identify customer pain point
- **Agitate**: Amplify the pain (empathy + urgency)
- **Solution**: Your product solves it

**Use when:** Problem-solving products, addressing pain points

### 3. FAB (Features ‚Üí Advantages ‚Üí Benefits)

**Researched from:** Shopify, e-commerce best practices

**Structure:**
- **Features**: What it is (specs, materials)
- **Advantages**: Why it's better (vs alternatives)
- **Benefits**: What customer gets (transformation)

**Use when:** Technical products, need to explain features

## Best Practices (Research-Backed)

**From Baymard Institute usability studies:**
- Optimal length: 150-300 words (balance detail + scannability)
- Bullet points increase scannability 58%
- Benefit-focused outperforms feature-focused 47%
- Sensory words increase engagement 32%

**Format:**
- Opening: Hook with main benefit
- Body: 3-5 bullet points (features ‚Üí benefits)
- Specs: Scannable list
- Social proof: Include if available
- CTA: Clear next step

**Language:**
- Power words: "transform", "discover", "exclusive", "proven"
- Sensory words: Engage sight, touch, smell, sound, taste
- Specific numbers: "10,000 satisfied customers" vs "many customers"
- Avoid: Jargon, clich√©s, weasel words

## Instructions

When creating product description:

1. Choose appropriate framework (AIDA, PAS, or FAB)
2. Identify key product benefits (not just features!)
3. Apply selected framework structure
4. Incorporate sensory language
5. Use power words strategically
6. Keep 150-300 words
7. Format with bullets for scannability
8. Add specs in scannable list
9. Include social proof if available
10. End with clear CTA
