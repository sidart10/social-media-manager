## MrBeast's 6 Core Principles

### 1. Mobile-First Colors
**Use:** Blue, Red, Green, Yellow (saturated, vibrant)
**Why:** Pop on dim phone screens at night
**Avoid:** Dark reds, purples, earth tones (disappear in feed)

### 2. Exaggerated Facial Expressions
**Science:** Brain processes faces 60,000x faster than text (MIT: 100ms)

**Expression Signals:**
- Wide eyes = "You won't believe this"
- Open mouth = "Shocking"
- Pointing = "Look at this"
- Smiling = "Fun"

### 3. One-Story Rule
**Rule:** ONE clear concept only
**Why:** Viewers have 0.3 seconds to understand
**Bad:** Multiple competing elements
**Good:** Single clear story (e.g., "$1 vs $1M Hotel")

### 4. Curiosity Gap
**Show:** Setup and intrigue
**Hide:** Payoff and resolution
**Result:** Viewer MUST click to satisfy curiosity

### 5. Text Strategy
**Options:**
- HUGE text (5 words max)
- OR no text at all

**Font:** Bold, thick (MrBeast uses Obelix Pro)
**Size:** Readable from across room on phone

### 6. Brand Consistency
**Effect:** 80% increase in recognition (Lucidpress study)
**Method:** Same energy, style, approach across all thumbnails

## Thomas Frank's AIDA Principle

**Thumbnail's job:** Put a BURNING question in viewer's mind

### A = Attention
- Grab attention FIRST (before title is read)
- Stand out vs other thumbnails
- Use exciting colors, clear faces, prominent elements

### I = Interest
- Connect to what audience already cares about
- Create curiosity gap
- Thumbnail + title combo builds interest

### D = Desire
- Burning question = strong desire to click
- Use powerful, desire-stoking words/images
- Don't be afraid of "clickbait" if video delivers

### A = Action
- If desire strong enough, they click
- Minimize friction, maximize intrigue

## Design Before Filming (Critical)

**Why Design First:**
- Clarifies target audience
- Structures script better
- Avoids post-production locks
- Thumbnail design = 80% psychology, 20% design skill

**Most creators work backwards:** Film → Edit → Scramble for thumbnail
**Pros work forwards:** Thumbnail concept → Film for it → Execute

## Technical Elements That Work

### Depth & Composition
**MrBeast's Recent Strategy:**
- Clear blue sky + horizon
- Vanishing point (draws eye in)
- Outdoor settings
- Foreground/background layers

### FaceTune Strategy
- Smooth skin (near-cartoonish)
- Symmetrical features
- No imperfections visible
- Exaggerated for attention

### Text Placement
**Gradient Trick:** Black-to-transparent gradient under text (readability without harsh boxes)

**Contrast Requirements:**
- White text = black outline
- Colored text = contrasting background

## Testing Protocol

**MrBeast's Team:**
- Creates 20 thumbnail variants per video
- Tests and iterates
- Changes thumbnail if CTR drops

**Your Process:**
1. Create 3-5 variants
2. Test different expressions, colors, text, emphasis
3. Monitor CTR for 24-48 hours
4. Swap if below channel average

**Tools:**
- YouTube Studio A/B testing
- ThumbsUp.tv (preview at all sizes)
- TubeBuddy

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Too Busy** - Multiple competing stories
2. **Text Mirrors Title** - Wasted opportunity (use different compelling text)
3. **Too Many Words** - Can't read quickly
4. **Low Contrast** - Disappears in feed
5. **Made After Filming** - Limited by what you shot
6. **No Testing** - Hope and pray (not a strategy)
7. **Small Text** - Unreadable on mobile

## Key Statistics

**MIT Study:** Faces processed in 100 milliseconds
**Microsoft Study:** Attention span = 8 seconds, initial judgment = 0.3 seconds
**Tubular Labs:** Effective thumbnails boost CTR by 300%
**Lucidpress:** Brand consistency increases recognition by 80%

## When Generating Thumbnails with AI

**Use this psychology to inform your prompts:**

**Good Prompt Structure:**
```
16:9 YouTube thumbnail with:
- [Exaggerated expression] face on LEFT THIRD
- Bold text "[MAX 5 WORDS]" on RIGHT
- [Primary color] and [Secondary color] high contrast
- Outdoor setting with depth and vanishing point
- Professional, curiosity-driven, eye-catching
```

**Include in negative prompts:**
- Low contrast, cluttered, small text, boring, dull colors, multiple stories

## The Core Rule

**Thomas Frank:** "If you have to convince yourself a part of your thumbnail is compelling, other people will NOT care."

**1of10:** "This isn't art, it's science."

**Thumbnail must hit like a ton of bricks IMMEDIATELY.**
