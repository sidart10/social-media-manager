## ⚠️ Warnings (Recommended Fixes)

### Warning 1: Gerund Form

**Issue:** Name `sid-ai-images` doesn't use gerund form

**Anthropic convention:** Action skills should use verb+ing form

**Recommendations:**
- `generating-sid-images` (emphasizes action)
- `creating-sid-images` (clearer action)

**OR keep current:** `sid-ai-images` is acceptable as a noun-based name for a personalized resource (not strictly an action)

**Decision:** Your choice - current name works, gerund would be more standard

---

### Warning 2: Missing "When" Guidance in Description

**Current description:**
```yaml
description: Generate personalized images of Sid in various scenarios using custom-trained FAL model. Supports professional headshots, social media content, creative scenarios, and video thumbnails. Applies Emily's JSON methodology and quality framework for consistent, professional results.
```

**Issue:** Doesn't explicitly say "Use when..."

**Fix:** Add when-clause:
```yaml
description: Generate personalized images of Sid in various scenarios using custom-trained FAL model. Use when creating Sid's professional headshots, social media content, video thumbnails, or personalized visuals. Supports professional headshots, creative scenarios, and consistent branding. Applies Emily's JSON methodology and quality framework.
```

**Before:** 278 chars
**After:** 367 chars (still well under 1024 limit)

**Benefit:** Better discovery - Claude knows WHEN to use skill

---

### Warning 3: Missing "When to Use" Section

**Current:** Has `## Purpose` but no `## When to Use This Skill`

**Recommended addition:**
```markdown
## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Creating professional headshots for Sid (LinkedIn, business photos)
- Generating social media profile images (Twitter, Instagram, YouTube)
- Creating video thumbnails featuring Sid
- Producing personalized content with Sid in various scenarios
- Need consistent, on-brand images of Sid
- Workflows require Sid's personalized imagery

**Don't use for:**
- Generic AI images (use `create-image` skill instead)
- Other people's images (this is Sid-specific)
- Stock photos or illustrations
```

**Benefit:** Clearer trigger conditions, helps Claude decide when to load

---

## Recommended Improvements

### Priority 1: Add "When to Use" Section (5 min)

**Add after `## Purpose`:**
```markdown
## When to Use This Skill

Use when workflows need personalized images of Sid for:
- Professional headshots (LinkedIn, business cards, media kits)
- Social media profiles (Twitter, Instagram, YouTube avatars)
- Video thumbnails (YouTube, social media video covers)
- Content featuring Sid (blog headers, podcast covers, promotional)
- Consistent branding across Sid's personal brand platforms

Triggers: Sid images, Sid headshot, Sid profile photo, personalized Sid content
```

---

### Priority 2: Enhance Description (2 min)

**Update YAML frontmatter:**
```yaml
---
name: sid-ai-images
description: Generate personalized images of Sid using custom-trained FAL LoRA model. Use when creating Sid's professional headshots, social media profiles, video thumbnails, or personalized content. Supports various scenarios (professional, creative, social media) with consistent quality using Emily's JSON methodology and 7-pillar evaluation framework.
---
```

**Changes:**
- ✅ Adds "Use when" clause
- ✅ More specific triggers (headshots, profiles, thumbnails)
- ✅ Mentions LoRA model (technical specificity)
- ✅ Length: 367/1024 chars (good!)

---

### Priority 3 (Optional): Consider Gerund Name

**Current:** `sid-ai-images`
**Alternative:** `generating-sid-images`

**Pros of change:**
- ✅ Follows Anthropic gerund convention
- ✅ More action-oriented
- ✅ Clearer it's a generation skill

**Cons of change:**
- ❌ Need to rename directory
- ❌ Update all references
- ❌ Current name works fine

**Recommendation:** Keep current name (acceptable), or rename if doing broader refactor
