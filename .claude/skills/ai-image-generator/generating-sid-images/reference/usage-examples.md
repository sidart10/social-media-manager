prompt: "Sid, ..."  # Must start with trigger

# Increase guidance scale
guidance_scale: 8.0-8.5
```

### Issue: Image too generic/stock-photo-like

**Solution:**
```yaml
# Reduce guidance scale for more creativity
guidance_scale: 6.0-6.5

# Add more specific details to prompt
# Include unique identifiers (specific location, activity)

# Strengthen negative prompts
negative_prompt: "...stock photo, generic, boring, conventional..."
```

### Issue: Inconsistent quality across generations

**Solution:**
```yaml
# Use consistent seed for testing
seed: 42

# Keep parameters constant
# Only vary prompt content

# Review and save successful parameter combos
```
