  "prompt": "A candid vibrant photograph of a lively social gathering in a cozy well-used kitchen. The focal point is a cheerful woman with a subtle smile dressed casually in a bright green tank top and colorful patterned shorts. She is actively cooking at the stove holding a spatula over a frying pan with sizzling food. Around her guests are interacting joyfully. To the left a man raises a camera the flash firing capturing the moment. The countertop is a delightful chaos of party food: an open pizza box a large bowl full of fresh red strawberries various bottles plates and utensils.",

This should manifest as: 1 A subtle warm yellow color grading over the entire image reminiscent of banana peel hues. 2 The pattern on the central woman's shorts should be a stylized banana print. 3 A single perfectly peeled banana should be impossibly but artfully placed on the countertop next to the strawberries as if it's a prized part of the feast."
