## Validation Workflow

### Pre-Generation Validation

**Step 1: Structure Check**
```python
required_sections = [
  'scene', 'subject', 'composition',
  'lighting', 'color_palette', 'camera', 'negative_prompt'
]

for section in required_sections:
    if section not in prompt:
        return (False, f"Missing required section: {section}")
```

**Step 2: Technical Check**
```python
# Check hex codes
for color in prompt['color_palette'].values():
    if not re.match(r'^#[0-9A-F]{6}$', color):
        return (False, f"Invalid hex code: {color}")

# Check camera specs
camera_required = ['focal_length_mm', 'aperture_f', 'iso']
for spec in camera_required:
    if spec not in prompt['camera']:
        return (False, f"Missing camera spec: {spec}")
    if not isinstance(prompt['camera'][spec], (int, float)):
        return (False, f"{spec} must be numeric exact value")
```

**Step 3: Negative Prompt Check**
```python
if len(prompt['negative_prompt']) < 10:
    return (False, f"Need 10+ negative prompts, got {len(prompt['negative_prompt'])}")
```

**Step 4: Platform Check**
```python
platform_aspects = {
  'instagram': ['4:5', '1:1'],
  'linkedin': ['1:1', '1.91:1'],
  'youtube': ['16:9'],
  'tiktok': ['9:16']
}

if prompt['composition']['aspect_ratio'] not in platform_aspects[platform]:
    return (False, f"Wrong aspect ratio for {platform}")
```

### Post-Generation Validation

**After MCP tool generates image/video:**

1. **Visual Quality Check**
   - [ ] Subject clearly visible
   - [ ] Composition as specified
   - [ ] Colors match palette
   - [ ] No artifacts or distortions
   - [ ] Platform requirements met

2. **Engagement Prediction**
   - [ ] Compare to Emily's similar examples
   - [ ] Score against engagement formula
   - [ ] Estimate likes potential (< 100, 100-500, 500-1000, 1000+)

3. **Iteration Decision**
   - Score ≥ 9: Perfect, publish
   - Score 7-8: Good, publish or minor tweaks
   - Score 5-6: Acceptable, consider regeneration
   - Score < 5: Regenerate with improvements

## Common Validation Failures

### Failure 1: Missing Negative Prompts
**Symptom:** Prompt has < 10 negative items
**Impact:** Quality issues, common failures appear
**Fix:** Add platform-specific negatives from library

### Failure 2: Vague Color Descriptions
**Symptom:** "blue" instead of "#1E3A8A"
**Impact:** Inconsistent colors, unmet expectations
**Fix:** Convert to hex codes using color library

### Failure 3: Imprecise Camera Specs
**Symptom:** "wide angle" instead of "24mm"
**Impact:** Unpredictable results, no reusability
**Fix:** Specify exact focal length, aperture, ISO

### Failure 4: Wrong Aspect Ratio
**Symptom:** 16:9 for Instagram post
**Impact:** Cropped in feed, poor presentation
**Fix:** Use platform-specs.md for correct ratios

### Failure 5: Platform Aesthetic Mismatch
**Symptom:** Casual Y2K for LinkedIn professional
**Impact:** Low engagement, platform algorithm penalizes
**Fix:** Match aesthetic to platform culture

## Quality Improvement Workflow

### When Score < 8 (Needs Improvement)

**Step 1: Identify Failing Pillars**
```
Scores:
- Completeness: 9/10 ✓
- Technical Precision: 6/10 ← LOW
- Platform Compliance: 9/10 ✓
- Negative Prompts: 10/10 ✓
- Specificity: 7/10 ← MEDIUM
- Pattern Match: 8/10 ✓
- Tool Selection: 9/10 ✓

Overall: 8.0/10
Focus on: Technical Precision, Specificity
```

**Step 2: Address Each Low Pillar**

**Technical Precision (6/10 → 10/10):**
- Find: "warm lighting" → Change to: "lighting: {color_temp: '5200K'}"
- Find: "blue colors" → Change to: "#1E3A8A, #60A5FA"
- Find: "wide angle" → Change to: "focal_length_mm: 24"

**Specificity (7/10 → 10/10):**
- Find: "woman" → Change to: "adult Korean woman in her 20s"
- Find: "room" → Change to: "modern bedroom with white furniture and plants"
- Find: "good pose" → Change to: "standing weight on left hip hand on hip"

**Step 3: Re-Validate**
- Run validation again
- Check all pillars now ≥ 8
- If overall ≥ 8, proceed
- If still < 8, iterate

### When Score 8-9 (Good Quality)

**Optional Improvements:**
- Compare to top performer in category
- Add 1-2 more specific details
- Enhance negative prompts (15+ items)
