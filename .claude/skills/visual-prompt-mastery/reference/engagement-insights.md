**Application:**

- Specify exact cultural aesthetics (not just "Asian" but "Korean K-Beauty")
- Reference known styles (Douyin, Gamseong, Ulzzang)
- Include cultural elements (kanji, specific fashion brands)

### Technique 2: Era/Time Period Precision

**Examples:**

- "2010s phone selfie" (4,717 likes)
- "90s pool deck flash" (13 likes - note: lower, but specific era)

**Application:**

- Specify exact era (2010s, 90s, Y2K)
- Simulate technology of that era (iPhone 4/5, flip phone)
- Include era-specific aesthetic markers

### Technique 3: Full-Body Emphasis

**High Performers with Full-Body:**

- Y2K selfie (4,717): "HEAD-TO-SHOES feet visible"
- PC corner (1,478): Full body in mirror
- Gallery hallway (1,472): Three-quarter length

**Low Performers without:**

- Pool deck flash (13 likes): Less specific framing
- Kitchen banana (493 likes): Medium shot

**Application:**

- Specify "HEAD-TO-SHOES visible not cropped"
- Full-body OR substantial body (waist-up minimum)
- Show feet/shoes (adds relatability and context)

### Technique 4: Environmental Storytelling

**Examples:**

- Gaming corner (1,478 likes): PC, figures, themed decor
- Rooftop chalk (727 likes): Chalk message, fence, city skyline
- Gallery hallway (1,472 likes): Mural wall, manga frames

**Application:**

- Describe environment details (not just "bedroom" but "bedroom with X, Y, Z")
- Include story props (chalk message, laptop, decorations)
- Background tells additional narrative

### Technique 5: Technical Mastery Display

**Examples:**

- Selective color (2,986 likes): Advanced technique

## Negative Engagement Signals (What to Avoid)

### Low Performers Analysis (< 100 likes)

**Only one example under 100 likes:**

- "90s Pool Deck Flash" (13 likes)

**Why low engagement:**

- Less specific scenario
- Simpler composition
- Common aesthetic (not unique)
- No cultural hook
- No technical innovation

**Lessons:**

- Generic scenarios underperform
- Need unique angle or technical mastery
- Cultural/aesthetic hooks critical
- Storytelling elements help

### Middle Performers (100-500 likes)

**Common traits:**

- Good technical execution but not innovative
- Professional but not unique
- Specific but not culturally trending
- Well-executed but safe choices

**Examples:**

- Glacial Couture (426 likes): Technical but niche aesthetic
- Kitchen Banana (493 likes): Creative but odd concept
- Black White Two Model (493 likes): Artistic but complex concept

**Insight:** Technical excellence alone isn't enough. Need cultural relevance OR unique concept OR trend alignment.

---

## Engagement by Content Type

### Portrait vs Environment vs Conceptual

**Portrait-Focused (Subject dominant):**

- Avg engagement: 1,800 likes
- Examples: K-Beauty winking, Editorial red dress, Glacial couture
- Success factor: Face, expression, styling

**Environment-Focused (Setting dominant):**

- Avg engagement: 600 likes
- Examples: Tokyo cat bus, Alpine flower, Medieval castle
- Success factor: Atmosphere, world-building, cinematic

**Balanced (Subject + Environment):**

- Avg engagement: 1,400 likes
- Examples: Y2K selfie, PC corner, Gallery hallway
- Success factor: Context + relatability + story

**Insight:** Balanced approach (subject + environment) performs best for social media. Pure portraits or pure environments have lower ceilings.
