## Negative Engagement Signals (What to Avoid)

### Low Performers Analysis (< 100 likes)

**Only one example under 100 likes:**
- "90s Pool Deck Flash" (13 likes)

**Why low engagement:**
- Less specific scenario
- Simpler composition
- Common aesthetic (not unique)
- No cultural hook
- No technical innovation

**Lessons:**
- Generic scenarios underperform
- Need unique angle or technical mastery
- Cultural/aesthetic hooks critical
- Storytelling elements help

### Middle Performers (100-500 likes)

**Common traits:**
- Good technical execution but not innovative
- Professional but not unique
- Specific but not culturally trending
- Well-executed but safe choices

**Examples:**
- Glacial Couture (426 likes): Technical but niche aesthetic
- Kitchen Banana (493 likes): Creative but odd concept
- Black White Two Model (493 likes): Artistic but complex concept

**Insight:** Technical excellence alone isn't enough. Need cultural relevance OR unique concept OR trend alignment.

## Engagement by Content Type

### Portrait vs Environment vs Conceptual

**Portrait-Focused (Subject dominant):**
- Avg engagement: 1,800 likes
- Examples: K-Beauty winking, Editorial red dress, Glacial couture
- Success factor: Face, expression, styling

**Environment-Focused (Setting dominant):**
- Avg engagement: 600 likes
- Examples: Tokyo cat bus, Alpine flower, Medieval castle
- Success factor: Atmosphere, world-building, cinematic

**Balanced (Subject + Environment):**
- Avg engagement: 1,400 likes
- Examples: Y2K selfie, PC corner, Gallery hallway
- Success factor: Context + relatability + story

**Insight:** Balanced approach (subject + environment) performs best for social media. Pure portraits or pure environments have lower ceilings.
