# Edit vs Regenerate - Decision Guide

**When to edit existing image vs create new one from scratch**

---

## Quick Decision Tree

```
START
  ↓
Is it a MINOR change?
  YES → EDIT
  NO → Continue
  ↓
Is it a TARGETED change (one specific thing)?
  YES → EDIT
  NO → Continue
  ↓
Do you like the current composition/layout?
  YES → EDIT (preserve what works)
  NO → REGENERATE
  ↓
Is it 3+ major changes?
  YES → REGENERATE (too complex for editing)
  NO → EDIT (or multi-turn edit)
```

## ✅ EDIT When:

### 1. Minor Adjustments
- Blur background
- Color correction
- Brightness/contrast tweak
- Small object removal
- Text typo fix

**Example**: "Blur background" → Edit in 20 seconds

### 2. Targeted Transformations
- One specific change
- Rest of image perfect
- Precise modification needed

**Example**: "Remove coffee cup from corner" → Edit preserves everything else

### 3. Good Base, Needs Polish
- 80% perfect, 20% needs improvement
- Composition good
- Just needs refinement

**Example**: "Image good but too bright" → Edit brightness only

### 4. Iterative Refinement
- Building quality gradually
- Multiple small improvements
- Testing variations

**Example**: Multi-turn editing (blur → color → sharpen)

### 5. Pixel-Perfect Precision Required
- Must not affect other elements
- Surgical precision needed
- Nanobanana's specialty

**Example**: "Blur only left side background" → Pixel-perfect editing

---

## ❌ REGENERATE When:

### 1. Major Composition Change
- Wrong framing
- Subject positioned poorly
- Need different layout

**Example**: "Subject should be on left not right" → Regenerate with new composition

### 2. Multiple Significant Changes
- 3+ major changes needed
- Editing would be complex/risky
- Cleaner to start fresh

**Example**: "Change background, adjust colors, reposition text, add logo" → Too many changes, regenerate

### 3. Wrong Subject/Content
- Fundamental content mismatch
- Different subject needed
- Wrong elements present

**Example**: "This shows a cat but I need a dog" → Regenerate completely

### 4. Complete Style Overhaul
- Dark to vibrant
- Professional to casual
- Different aesthetic entirely

**Example**: "Change from dark tech to bright colorful" → Regenerate is cleaner

### 5. Text Rendering Issues
- Text illegible or wrong
- Complex text changes
- GPT-image-1 better for text

**Example**: "Text is blurry, need crisp rendering" → Regenerate with gpt-image-1

### 6. Quality Below 5/10
- Fundamental quality issues
- Artifacts, poor composition
- Not salvageable with edits

**Example**: "Image has artifacts and wrong colors" → Regenerate from scratch

## Cost & Time Comparison

### Edit Approach
```
Time: ~20-60 seconds (per edit)
Cost: $0.039 per edit
Risk: Low (preserves what works)
Result: Refined version of original
```

### Regenerate Approach
```
Time: ~75-90 seconds (gpt-image-1)
Cost: Higher (variable pricing)
Risk: Medium (might lose good elements)
Result: Completely new image
```

### Decision Factors:

| Factor | Favors Edit | Favors Regenerate |
|--------|------------|-------------------|
| **Time** | ✅ Faster (20s) | Slower (90s) |
| **Cost** | ✅ Cheaper ($0.039) | More expensive |
| **Risk** | ✅ Low (preserves good) | Medium (might change) |
| **Scope** | Minor changes | Major overhaul |
| **Quality** | Refining good base | Starting from scratch |

## Real-World Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Background Distraction
**Issue**: Background too busy
**Edit**: ✅ Blur background (nanobanana)
**Time**: 20 seconds
**Result**: Perfect focus on subject

### Scenario 2: Wrong Text
**Issue**: Typo "Comming Soon" should be "Coming Soon"
**Edit**: ✅ Fix typo (nanobanana)
**Time**: 20 seconds
**Alternative**: Regenerate with gpt-image-1 for perfect text

### Scenario 3: Wrong Color Scheme
**Issue**: Vibrant colors but need dark monochrome
**Regenerate**: ✅ Complete style change
**Reason**: Editing would be complex, regenerate cleaner

### Scenario 4: Subject Positioned Wrong
**Issue**: Subject on right, needs to be on left
**Regenerate**: ✅ Composition fundamental change
**Reason**: Editing can't reposition subjects well

### Scenario 5: Multiple Touch-Ups
**Issue**: Blur background + color correct + sharpen
**Edit**: ✅ Multi-turn editing (3 turns)
**Workflow**:
- Turn 1: Blur background
- Turn 2: Color correct
- Turn 3: Sharpen subject
**Total**: ~1 minute, $0.117

## Hybrid Approach

### Strategy: Generate → Edit

**Best Results Often Come From Combining:**

**Step 1**: Generate high-quality base (gpt-image-1)
```yaml
mcp__gpt-image-1__create_image:
  prompt: "Professional LinkedIn post..."
  size: "1536x1024"
  quality: "high"
# Result: Professional base image
```

**Step 2**: Pixel-perfect refinements (nanobanana)
```yaml
mcp__nanobanana__generate_image:
  prompt: "Blur background, add subtle vignette"
  mode: "edit"
  input_image_path_1: "step1-result.png"
# Result: Polished final image
```

**Why Hybrid**:
- OpenAI: Best photorealistic base
- Gemini: Best targeted refinements
- Combines strengths
- Professional + polished

## Decision Framework

### Ask These Questions:

**1. How many changes needed?**
- 1-2 minor → EDIT
- 3+ major → REGENERATE

**2. Is composition correct?**
- YES → EDIT (preserve layout)
- NO → REGENERATE

**3. Is current quality ≥ 6/10?**
- YES → EDIT (build on good base)
- NO → REGENERATE (start fresh)

**4. Do you like most of it?**
- YES → EDIT (keep what works)
- NO → REGENERATE

**5. Is it a targeted change?**
- YES → EDIT (nanobanana's strength)
- NO → REGENERATE

## When in Doubt

**Default Strategy**:
1. Try editing first (fast, cheap, low-risk)
2. If result unsatisfactory → Regenerate
3. Worst case: Lost 20 seconds and $0.039

**Best case**: Perfect result in 20 seconds!

## Examples: Clear Winners

### Clear EDIT Winners:
- "Blur background" ← 100% edit
- "Remove watermark" ← 100% edit
- "Adjust brightness" ← 100% edit
- "Fix color cast" ← 100% edit
- "Enhance sharpness" ← 100% edit

### Clear REGENERATE Winners:
- "Change subject from cat to dog" ← 100% regenerate
- "Flip from vertical to horizontal" ← 100% regenerate
- "Change entire aesthetic" ← 100% regenerate
- "Reposition all elements" ← 100% regenerate
- "Start with different idea" ← 100% regenerate

### Judgment Calls:
- "Change text content" ← Edit for simple, regenerate for complex
- "Adjust multiple colors" ← Edit if minor, regenerate if major
- "Add new element" ← Edit for small addition, regenerate for major
- "Style transfer" ← Try edit first, regenerate if insufficient
