```yaml
mcp__nanobanana__generate_image:
  prompt: "Composite person from first image into office environment from second image. Position person at desk in foreground, office background behind. Natural lighting integration - match lighting direction (window light from left in office). Match color temperature and shadows. Person should look naturally present in the office, not pasted. Photorealistic, seamless composition, professional quality."
  mode: "generate"
  input_image_path_1: "/photos/headshot.jpg"
  input_image_path_2: "/photos/office-background.jpg"
  negative_prompt: "cut-out appearance, pasted look, mismatched lighting, different color temperatures, artificial composition, visible edges, halo around subject, green screen artifacts"
  n: 1
```

**Result**:
- Person naturally integrated into office

## Blending Tips

### 1. Lighting Consistency is Critical
Always mention: "match lighting from [source image]" in prompt

### 2. Specify Element Sources Clearly
"Person from first image", "background from second image"

### 3. Scale Matters
Ensure subjects are appropriate relative sizes

### 4. Natural Integration
Mention: "natural, seamless, not pasted, photorealistic"

### 5. Use Negatives
Prevent common composition failures

## Blending vs Creating

### When to Blend:
✅ Have perfect source images to combine
✅ Specific elements from each wanted
✅ Creative composition from existing assets
✅ Cost-effective (reuse existing photos)

### When to Create New:
❌ No good source images
❌ Simpler to generate fresh
❌ Need perfect cohesion (all generated together)
