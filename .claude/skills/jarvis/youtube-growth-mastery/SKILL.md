**Tool:** [Triple Venn Diagram Template](https://www.readwritethink.org/sites/default/files/resources/printouts/Venn3Circles.pdf)

---

#### Step 2: Laser Focus

**Rule:** You don't go to a burger restaurant and order fish.

**Action:** Stick to your niche. Don't distract audience with random topics.

**Why:** Algorithm rewards consistency. Viewers subscribe for specific content.

---

#### Step 3: Study the Craft

**What to Study:**
- Favorite creators in your niche
- Their posting frequency
- Their editing style
- Their thumbnail patterns
- Their title formulas
- Tools they use (check credits)

**Action:** Make lists. Analyze top 10 channels in your niche.

---

#### Step 4: Make 2 Videos/Week

**Duration:** First 16 weeks

**Why:**
- Volume builds skill faster
- More data to learn from
- Algorithm learns your channel
- You find your voice

**Action:** Commit to bi-weekly uploads. No excuses.

---

#### Step 5: 100 Ideas Per Week

**Process:**
- Write out EVERY idea (even bad ones)
- Mining for gold requires digging through dirt
- Study outliers (surprise successes from other channels)
- Learn to identify good ideas faster

**Action:** Weekly brainstorm session, pen and paper, 100 ideas minimum.

---

#### Step 6: Master A/B Testing

**Start With:** Thumbnails

**Process:**
- Create 2 thumbnails per video
- Use TubeBuddy or YouTube Studio
- Test which performs better
- Learn from results
- Apply lessons to next video

- Time to focus on quality over quantity
- Same effort, better output
- Breathing room to implement learnings

**Action:** Put same effort into 1 video that you were putting into 2.

- What viewer demographics engaged?

**Bottom 5 Analysis:**

**Action:** Document lessons learned. Apply to next video.
