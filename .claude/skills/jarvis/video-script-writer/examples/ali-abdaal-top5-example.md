## SCRIPT

### [0:00-0:25] OPENING

Welcome back to the channel. In this video, I'm going to show you 5 AI tools that have genuinely saved me about 10 hours every single week. And I'm not talking about the obvious ones everyone already knows about.

**Visual Direction**:
- Medium shot, centered desk setup
- Eye contact with camera
- Calm, welcoming energy

**Retention Tactic**: Clear promise (10 hours saved) + curiosity (not the obvious ones)

### [0:25-2:30] TIP 2: Notion AI for Meeting Notes (second-best)

So Tip Number 2 is Notion AI, specifically for meeting notes.

Here's what I do: I record every meeting, upload the audio to Notion, and it automatically generates summaries, action items, and follow-ups. This saves me probably 2-3 hours per week that I used to spend reviewing recordings or trying to remember what was said.

The game-changer here is the action item extraction. Instead of me having to listen to a 45-minute meeting again to figure out what I need to do, Notion AI just gives me a clean list. Click, done.

**Visual Direction**:
- Screen recording of Notion interface
- Show before/after (manual notes vs AI summary)
- B-roll: You at desk reviewing notes

**Pacing Note**: Moderate energy, demonstration-focused

**Pattern Interrupt**: "The game-changer here is..."

---

### [2:30-4:45] TIP 3: Descript for Video Editing (third-best)

Tip Number 3 is Descript, which has completely changed how I edit videos.

Traditional video editing: You're scrubbing through timelines, cutting clips, moving things around. It takes forever.

With Descript, you edit the transcript, and it edits the video. If I delete a sentence from the transcript, that section disappears from the video. It's basically editing a Google Doc instead of editing in Premiere Pro.

This alone saves me probably 3-4 hours per video. And since I make 2-3 videos per week, that's massive.

**Visual Direction**:
- Split screen: Traditional editing vs Descript
- Screen recording of transcript editing
- Show time saved (timer visual)

**Pacing Note**: Building momentum

**Pattern Interrupt**: "Traditional video editing: You're scrubbing..."

---

### [4:45-7:15] TIP 4: Claude for Research Synthesis (SURPRISE - at 50% mark)

Okay, so this one's interesting. Tip Number 4 is using Claude—not ChatGPT—specifically for research synthesis.

Here's something no one really talks about: When you're researching a topic, you don't just need answers. You need *synthesis*—connecting different sources, finding patterns, building frameworks.

I tried doing this with ChatGPT for months, and it was fine. But when I switched to Claude for research work, the quality jumped noticeably. It handles longer context better, and it's much better at actually synthesizing information rather than just summarizing it.

This saves me probably 2 hours per video on research prep.

**Visual Direction**:
- Screen recording comparing ChatGPT vs Claude outputs
- Highlight quality difference visually
- You explaining the nuance

**Pacing Note**: HIGH energy—this is the re-engagement moment

**Retention Tactic**: Unexpected insight (Claude vs ChatGPT), counterintuitive recommendation

**Pattern Interrupt**: "Here's something no one really talks about..."

---

### [7:15-9:30] TIP 5: Zapier Automation (necessary but boring)

Tip Number 5 is Zapier, which I know sounds boring, but hear me out.

The specific use case that saves me time: Automatically sending Slack messages when certain tasks are completed. So when a video finishes uploading, when a blog post goes live, when someone books a call—Zapier handles all the notifications.

It's not sexy, but it saves me probably 30 minutes per day just in checking different platforms and manual updates.

**Visual Direction**:
- Screen recording of Zapier workflows
- Show automated notifications in action
- B-roll: You NOT having to check multiple apps

**Pacing Note**: Moderate, practical tone

---

### [9:30-11:15] TIP 1: Custom GPT for Content Repurposing (BEST - finale)

And now, the tool that saves me the most time—Tip Number 1: A custom GPT I built specifically for content repurposing.

Here's how it works: I take a YouTube video transcript, feed it to this custom GPT, and it automatically generates:
- 5 Twitter threads
- 3 LinkedIn posts
- 10 quote graphics
- Newsletter section

All in my voice, all structured correctly, all ready to post with minor edits.

This single tool saves me probably 4-5 hours per video. And since I make multiple videos per week, we're talking 15-20 hours saved per month just from this one custom GPT.

If you only implement one thing from this video, make it this. The ROI is absurd.

**Visual Direction**:
- Screen recording of custom GPT in action
- Show input (transcript) → output (repurposed content)
- Visual of time saved calculation
- High energy, enthusiasm

**Pacing Note**: HIGHEST energy—this is the payoff

**Retention Tactic**: Delivering the BEST content at the end (finale)

**Pattern Interrupt**: "If you only implement one thing..."

### [11:15-11:50] CLOSING

So those are the 5 AI tools: Notion AI, Descript, Claude, Zapier, and my custom content repurposing GPT.

Quick recap: We're talking 10+ hours saved per week, genuinely.

Now, I left one tool off this list on purpose—something I use for email management that's even more powerful than what I showed you here. I might make a separate video about it if you want to see that. Let me know in the comments.

If you found this valuable, hit subscribe. I make videos like this every week.
