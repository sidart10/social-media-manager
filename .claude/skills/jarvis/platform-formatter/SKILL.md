## Instructions

### Step 1: Identify Target Platform

**From user input or workflow parameter:**

- Platform: {twitter|linkedin|instagram|reels|tiktok|youtube}

**If multiple platforms requested:**

- Format for each separately
- Note variations in output

### Step 2: Analyze Content Length

**Check character count:**

- If exceeds platform limit: Trim or restructure
- If under optimal: Consider if more value can be added
- If way under minimum: Flag as too short

**Trimming Strategy (if needed):**

1. Remove redundant words
2. Shorten sentences
3. Cut less critical points
4. Preserve hook and CTA
5. Maintain voice and value

### Step 3: Apply Platform Structure

**For each platform, enforce:**

**Hook Placement:**

- Ensure hook in first line (or first 3 words for short-form)
- Make it compelling and complete
- No cliff-hangers that require expanding (except Instagram feed)

**Body Formatting:**

- Apply platform-specific line breaks
- Add bullets if appropriate
- Insert emojis if platform-appropriate
- Structure for scannability

**CTA Formatting:**

- Platform-appropriate ask
- Clear and specific
- Positioned correctly

**Hashtag Handling:**

- Right number for platform
- Positioned correctly
- Relevant and researched
- Mix trending + niche for discovery platforms

### Step 4: Optimize for Platform Algorithm

**Twitter:**

- Engagement-focused CTA
- Thread indicators if multi-tweet
- Use spaces around emojis

**LinkedIn:**

- Professional tone maintained
- First 2 lines critical (preview)
- Tag relevant connections
- Use "..." if needed in hook to drive clicks

**Instagram Feed:**

- First 125 characters = preview
- Hook must work standalone
- Consider hashtags in first comment
- Save CTA for algorithmic boost

**Reels/TikTok:**

- Very short, punchy
- Trending hashtag required
- Caption complements video
- Engagement CTA (duet, stitch)

**YouTube:**

- SEO-optimized first 200 chars
- Timestamps for retention
- Comprehensive but scannable

### Step 5: Output Formatted Content

**Return structure:**

```markdown
# Platform-Formatted Content

**Platform:** {platform}
**Character Count:** {count} / {limit}

---

## Formatted Content

{formatted_content}

---

**Applied Formatting:**

- Length: {optimized|within limits|trimmed}
- Hashtags: {count} ({position})
- Structure: {platform_structure}
- CTA: {cta_type}

**Platform Compliance:** ‚úÖ Ready to post

## Quality Standards

- Must respect platform character limits (hard stop)
- Structure must follow platform best practices
- Hashtag count must match platform guidelines
- CTA must be platform-appropriate
- Formatting must enhance readability
- Voice must be preserved during formatting

## Edge Cases

**Content too long for platform:**

- Trim systematically (remove redundancy first)
- If still too long, suggest thread (Twitter) or carousel (Instagram)
- Preserve core message and hook

**Multiple platforms requested:**

- Create separate version for each
- Note key differences
- Optimize each individually (don't just copy-paste)

**Platform not recognized:**

- Ask user to clarify
- List supported platforms
- Return unformatted content with note
