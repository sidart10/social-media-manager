## Why This Works

**Thread Structure**:
- Tweet 1: Hook with curiosity ("Most people don't know about #4")
- Tweet 2: Stakes (tested 47 tools, only 5 worth it)
- Tweets 3-7: One tool per tweet with specific value
- Tweet 7: Clear CTA (follow + RT)

**Engagement Tactics**:
- Specific numbers ("10+ hours", "47 tools tested")
- Curiosity gap (#4 teaser)
- One idea per tweet (scannable)
- Emojis as visual markers (â†’)
- Personality ("criminally underrated", "PowerPoint hell")

**Performance indicators**:
- <250 chars per tweet âœ“
- 7 tweets (optimal length) âœ“
- Visual breaks suggested (screenshots of tools)
- Thread indicator (ðŸ§µ)
