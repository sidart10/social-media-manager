## Hook Writing Principles

### The First 210 Characters (Above the Fold)

**This is your ONLY chance to stop the scroll.**

**3-Line Hook Structure**:
```
Line 1: {Bold statement, question, or relatable problem}

Line 2: {Amplification, tension, or surprise}

Line 3: {Promise, tease, or intrigue}
```

**Hook Types That Work**:

1. **Thought-Provoking Question**
   "What's the most important skill for success in {industry} today?"

2. **Surprising Statistic**
   "70% of {professionals} struggle with {issue}. Here's why:"

3. **Controversial Opinion**
   "I know this is controversial, but {opinion}."

4. **Personal Story**
   "When I started, I had no idea what I was doing. Now:"

5. **Bold Claim**
   "The most successful leaders all have one thing in common."

6. **Problem-Solution Tease**
   "Struggling with {problem}? Here's the fix nobody talks about."

7. **Relatable Enemy** (Justin Welsh)
   "The {hated thing} is {getting worse}."

8. **Data-Driven**
   "I analyzed {number} {things}. The pattern is shocking:"

### Hook Quality Test

Ask yourself:
- Can reader tell the value in 3 seconds? (If no, rewrite)
- Does it create curiosity gap? (Unanswered question)
- Does it trigger emotion? (Surprise, frustration, hope, curiosity)
- Is it specific? (Not vague)

If answer is "no" to any, REWRITE the hook.

## Body Writing Guidelines

### Formatting (40% More Engagement)

**Do**:
- ✅ Short paragraphs (2-3 lines max)
- ✅ Blank lines between sections
- ✅ Bullet points for lists
- ✅ Bold for **key phrases**
- ✅ Emojis (1-3 total) for visual markers

**Don't**:
- ❌ Walls of text
- ❌ Long paragraphs (>4 lines)
- ❌ No spacing
- ❌ All caps (EXCEPT short emphasis)

### Length (<200 Words = More Engagement)

**Word count targets**:
- Short post: 100-150 words
- Standard post: 150-200 words
- Maximum: 200 words (going over hurts engagement)

**How to stay concise**:
- One idea per post (focus)
- Delete unnecessary words
- Use active voice
- Short sentences

### Voice & Tone

**Write like you talk**:
- Use contractions ("I'm", "you're", "it's")
- Casual but professional
- "You" (talk TO reader, not AT them)
- Avoid corporate jargon

**If voice_profile provided**:
- Match vocabulary level
- Use signature phrases naturally
- Apply tone score (1=formal, 10=casual)
- Mirror sentence patterns

**If NO voice profile**:
- Default: Conversational, clear, authentic
- Professional but approachable
- Specific, not vague

## CTA Best Practices (2x More Engagement)

**Strong CTAs** (clear action):
- "Follow me for daily {topic} insights"
- "Comment your biggest {related question}"
- "Share this if you found it valuable"
- "Tag someone who needs this"

**Soft CTAs** (conversational):
- "Thoughts?"
- "What's your experience with this?"
- "Let's discuss in comments"

**Combo** (value + question):
```
Want more {topic} tips? Follow for weekly posts.

What's your favorite {related item}?
```

## Research Integration

If {research_brief} provided:
- **Cite statistics**: "According to {source}, {stat}..."
- **Quote experts**: "\"{Quote}\" - {Expert Name}"
- **Reference studies**: "Research shows {finding}..."
- **Add credibility**: Don't just state opinions, back with data

**Balance**: 70% your insight, 30% external validation

## Engagement Optimization

### Tagging Strategy (56% Higher Engagement)

**When to tag**:
- Mentioned someone's work
- Sharing someone's quote
- Responding to someone's idea
- Collaborative insight

**How many**: 3-5 people maximum (more = spam)

**How**: @FirstName LastName (LinkedIn format)

### Visual Suggestions

**When post benefits from visual**:
- Data/stats → Infographic or chart
- Process/steps → Carousel
- Personal story → Authentic photo
- Tips/list → Visual list graphic

**Visual specs**:
- Format: 1200x627px (LinkedIn standard)
- Style: Clean, professional, on-brand
- Text: Large, readable, minimal

## Common LinkedIn Mistakes

1. ❌ **Generic hook**: "Excited to share..." (instant scroll)
2. ❌ **Long intro**: "I've been thinking about..." (bury lede)
3. ❌ **Wall of text**: No formatting (kills readability)
4. ❌ **Too corporate**: Jargon-heavy (feels inauthentic)
5. ❌ **No CTA**: Assume engagement (missed opportunity)
6. ❌ **Over-tagging**: >5 people (looks spammy)
7. ❌ **Too many hashtags**: >5 (looks desperate)
8. ❌ **Weekend posting**: Lower engagement (post Tue-Thu)

## Formula Examples

### PAIPS Example:
```
Most creators burn out within 6 months. [PROBLEM]

They try posting daily, chasing trends, copying others. [AGITATE]
It's exhausting. Unsustainable.

But what if there's a better way? [INTRIGUE]

Imagine posting 3x/week and getting BETTER results. [POSITIVE FUTURE]
More engagement. Less stress. Actual sustainability.

Here's the system: [SOLUTION]
• Focus on quality over quantity
• Find YOUR voice, not trends
• Build systems, not habits

This changed everything for me.

Follow for sustainable creator strategies.

What's your posting frequency?

### Relatable Enemy Example:
```
The "post daily or fail" advice is killing creators.

The "quality over quantity" movement is growing.

And I love it. Why?
