{trailing question or incomplete thought}
```

**Example (2,862 likes)**:
```
how do kids even learn at school anymore now that AI exists?

the entire education system was designed for a world where memorizing mattered, and that world is dead.

we should be retooling education so kids learn how to think, judge, and create

why isn't anyone talking about
```

**Characteristics**:
- All lowercase (casual, accessible)
- Multi-line (readability)
- Ends mid-thought (curiosity gap)

**Data-Driven Analysis Format**:

```
{Bold opener about data/trend/product}

{Analysis with specific insights} {Context or comparison}

{Final commentary connecting to bigger picture} [+ visual if available]
```

**Example (1,407 likes)**:
```
Here's every single product OpenAI is working on.

It makes a lot of sense. Reminds me of early Facebook / Google. When you have distribution (~1B users), just build everything and see what sticks.

And who better to run that playbook than the ex-boss of Y Combinator!
```

**Characteristics**:
- Proper grammar and capitalization
- Specific data/facts
- Tech/business analysis

A kid applying to college told me:

"you have to be an idiot to say you're Asian with a 'startup' applying for engineering or CS. Everyone makes up a lie about how they're into Latin / African American studies and plays squash / lacrosse.

Narrative is everything."
```

**Characteristics**:
- Real conversation/quote
- Quotation marks for attribution
- Punch line ties it together
- Controversial or surprising content

**Minimal Text + Powerful Image Format**:

```
{1-3 word reaction}
```

**Examples**:
- "yeah" (6,323 likes - MOST VIRAL)

## QUALITY CHECKLIST

- [ ] Creates curiosity or provides instant value
- [ ] Authentic voice (not corporate)

- [ ] Visual recommended/attached (if applicable)
- [ ] 0-2 hashtags max (if using any)
- [ ] Ready to post Tue-Thu, 9-11am or 1-3pm EST
```

## Writing Guidelines

### Character Economy

**Every character counts at 280 limit**:
- Cut unnecessary words
- Use contractions ("I'm" vs "I am")
- Remove filler ("I think", "In my opinion")
- Get to point immediately

**Sweet spot**: 70-110 characters (most engaging despite 280 limit available)

### Line Break Strategy

**Greg Isenberg style** (multi-line):
```
line 1: hook

line 2: context

line 3: insight

line 4: question
```

**Benefits**:
- Scannable
- Creates rhythm
- Prevents wall of text
- Each line = digestible thought

**When to use**: Tweets with multiple thoughts or progression

### Single Line vs Multi-Line

**Single line** (good for):
- One clear idea
- Quick reaction
- Quote tweets
- Image commentary

**Multi-line** (good for):
- Progressive thought
- Question + answer
- Setup + punch line
- Narrative flow

### Capitalization Strategy

**Lowercase** (Greg style):
- More casual
- Accessible
- "One of us" vibe
- Good for: Philosophical, thought-provoking

**Proper case** (Deedy style):
- Professional
- Credible
- Polished
- Good for: Data, announcements, analysis

**Match to content type and audience.**

### Ending Strategy

**Options**:
1. **Period** (.) - Complete thought
2. **No punctuation** - Casual, ongoing
3. **Question mark** (?) - Invites response
4. **Trailing thought** - Creates curiosity (Greg's "why isn't anyone talking about")
5. **Ellipsis** (...) - Leaves hanging

**Most engaging**: Trailing thought or question (prompts replies)

## Voice Adaptation

If {voice_profile} provided:
- Match capitalization preference
- Use signature phrases
- Mirror tone (1=formal, 10=casual)
- Apply vocabulary level

If NO voice profile:
- Default: Conversational, authentic
- Match style to topic (data = professional, opinion = casual)
- Write how you'd text a friend

## Image Integration

### When Image Available

**Minimal text works** (Greg's "yeah" = 6.3K likes):
- 1-3 words
- Let image tell story
- Ultra-casual commentary

**Image + Analysis** (Deedy's OpenAI = 1.4K likes):
- Describe what image shows
- Add your analysis
- Image proves your point

**Image as proof**:
- Charts support data claims
- Screenshots validate statements
- Photos humanize content

### When NO Image

**Text must work alone**:
- Hook stronger
- More context needed
- Can still go viral (Greg's education tweet = 2.8K likes, no image)

## Engagement Triggers

**Elements that drive replies**:
- ✅ Questions (especially trailing)
- ✅ Controversial takes
- ✅ "Fill in the blank" prompts
- ✅ "Agree or disagree?"

**Elements that drive retweets**:
- ✅ Data/insights (shareable value)
- ✅ Bold claims (people want to amplify)
- ✅ Quotes (attributable wisdom)
- ✅ Visuals (eye-catching in feed)

**Elements that drive likes**:
- ✅ Relatable observations
- ✅ Humor
- ✅ Truth-telling
- ✅ Emotional resonance

## Common Mistakes

1. ❌ **Using full 280 chars** (shorter often performs better)
2. ❌ **No line breaks** (wall of text)
3. ❌ **Vague hooks** (no clear point)
4. ❌ **Corporate tone** (inauthentic)
5. ❌ **Too many hashtags** (>2 hurts engagement)
6. ❌ **Complete thoughts only** (no curiosity gaps)
7. ❌ **Ignoring visuals** (2x engagement opportunity missed)

**Remember**: Single tweets are about instant impact. Hook in first line, deliver in remaining characters, make every word count.
