## Style Selection

### If style = "paul_graham_essay":

**Use Paul Graham's Techniques**:

```
SUBJECT LINE: Curiosity + Specificity
"Why good writers sound boring (and how to fix it)"

OPENING: Hook with self-riffing
{Surprising observation or question}
{Reference back to observation, create momentum}

SECTION 1: Core Concept

**Paul Graham Techniques**:
1. **Self-riffing**: Reference own language for smooth transitions
2. **Strategic vocabulary**: Sophisticated phrases SPARINGLY for impact
3. **Conversational authenticity**: Mix contractions + formal, sound human
4. **Rhetorical questions**: Create momentum, invite engagement
5. **Tonal variety**: Balance high/low diction = approachable expertise

**Core Principle**: "Simple vocabulary ≠ simple writing" - Complexity in structure/rhythm

OPENING (2-3 paragraphs):

Set up the "why this matters" quickly

## Subject Line Engineering

**Subject line = Email open rate**

**Effective patterns**:
- **Curiosity**: "The writing trick nobody talks about"
- **Benefit**: "How to write faster without quality loss"
- **Controversy**: "Why {popular belief} is wrong"
- **Intrigue**: "I spent $10K learning this. Here's what:"
- **Specificity**: "3 essays that changed my thinking on {topic}"

**Avoid**:
- Vague ("Some thoughts")
- Clickbait ("You won't believe...")
- All caps (LOOKS SPAMMY)
- Too long (>60 characters gets cut off)

**Test**: Would YOU open this email? If hesitant, rewrite.

## Opening Hook (First Paragraph)

**YOU HAVE ONE PARAGRAPH to hook the reader.**

**Effective openings**:
1. **Surprising observation**: "Everyone talks about X. Nobody mentions Y."
2. **Question**: "What makes good writing good?"
3. **Bold statement**: "I wasted 6 months doing this wrong."
4. **Story moment**: "Last Tuesday, I realized something obvious:"
5. **Contradiction**: "The advice everyone gives is backwards."

**Opening paragraph quality test**:
- Creates curiosity? (Unanswered question)
- Sets expectation? (Reader knows where this goes)
- Feels authentic? (Sounds like human, not AI)

## Body Writing Principles

### Conversational Depth

**Write like you talk** (but better):
- Use contractions naturally ("I'm", "you're", "it's")
- Include rhetorical questions ("What does this mean?")
- Vary sentence length (short. Medium length. Sometimes a longer sentence that explores a thought more fully.)
- One-line paragraphs for emphasis

**Paul Graham's approach**:
- Simple vocabulary (accessible)
- Complex structure (sophisticated without pretension)
- Strategic "fancy" words (occasional flash of eloquence)

### Paragraph Rhythm

**Vary paragraph length**:
- Short (1 line): Emphasis, punch
- Medium (2-4 lines): Standard explanation
- Long (5-7 lines): Deep exploration

**Don't**: Write same-length paragraphs throughout (monotonous)

### Subheadings (Skimmability)

**Use ## subheadings every 300-500 words**:
- Breaks up long text
- Allows skimming
- Creates natural sections

**Subheading style**:
- Clear, specific (not vague)
- Can be questions
- Or bold statements

### Rhetorical Questions (Engagement)

**Sprinkle throughout** (every 2-3 paragraphs):
- "What does this mean for you?"
- "Why does this matter?"
- "Sound familiar?"

**Paul Graham's double questions**:
"What sort of people do this? Can anyone learn it?"

**Purpose**: Creates conversational feel, invites reader thinking

## Research Integration

If {research_brief} provided:
- **Weave naturally**: Don't info-dump
- **Cite sources**: Build credibility
- **Use quotes**: Social proof
- **Present data**: Support arguments

**Balance**: 60% your insights, 40% external validation

## Voice Adaptation

If {voice_profile} provided:
- Match vocabulary sophistication
- Mirror sentence patterns
- Use signature phrases
- Apply tonal preferences

If NO voice profile:
- Conversational, authentic
- Educated but accessible
- Personal without oversharing
- Specific, not vague

## Closing Strategy

**Don't force CTAs**:
- Substack is about connection, not conversion
- Optional soft ask ("Thoughts?" "Reply if...")
- Natural transition to comments

**Strong closings**:
- Reflection on topic
- Call back to opening (creates closure)
- Question to ponder
- Tease next newsletter (optional)

**P.S. Section** (Highly effective):
- Behind-scenes insight
- Personal note
- Preview upcoming content
- Humanizes the newsletter

## Substack-Specific Features
