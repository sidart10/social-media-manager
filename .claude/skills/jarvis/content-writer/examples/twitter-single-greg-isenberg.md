## Why This Works

**Greg Isenberg Pattern Applied**:

1. **Provocative question**: "how do kids even learn..."
2. **Context/Current state**: "education system was designed for..."
3. **What should change**: "we should be retooling..."
4. **Trailing question**: "why isn't anyone talking about" (NO punctuation - curiosity gap)

**Style Elements**:

- All lowercase (accessible, casual)
- Multi-line breaks (readability)
- Ends mid-thought (compels engagement)
- Philosophical/systemic thinking
- No period at end

**Character count**: 267/280

**Engagement potential**: HIGH

- Question format invites replies
- Controversial angle (education system critique)
- Trailing thought creates replies ("...talking about WHAT?")

**Performance**: Original Greg tweet with this format got 2,862 likes, 936 replies
