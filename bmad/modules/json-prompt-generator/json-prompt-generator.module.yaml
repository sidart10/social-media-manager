  description: |
    Generates structured JSON prompts following Emily's quality standards for image and video generation.
    Provides comprehensive templates with technical precision, negative prompts, and 7-pillar quality benchmarking.

  capabilities:
    - Generate JSON prompts for photorealistic images
    - Generate JSON prompts for single video scenes
    - Generate JSON prompts for multi-scene video sequences (flexible 3-20+ scenes)
    - Convert JSON prompts to natural language text
    - Maintain visual consistency across sequences
    - Apply Emily's 7-pillar quality framework

  templates:
    video_scene:
      path: templates/video-scene.json
      description: Single video shot/scene with complete technical specifications
      use_for: Individual scenes, key frames, single shots

    video_sequence:
      path: templates/video-sequence.json
      description: Multi-scene video with flexible scene count (3-20+) and global consistency
      use_for: Story arcs, evolution videos, tutorials, timelines
      features:
        - Flexible scene count (dynamic array)
        - Global consistency settings (lens, grain, color evolution)
        - Scene inheritance (each scene uses global + scene-specific)
        - Transition specifications

    image_photorealistic:
      path: templates/image-photorealistic.json
      description: Emily's format for fashion, portraits, product photography
      use_for: High-quality photorealistic images

    - workflows/generate-video-sequence-prompt.yaml

  quality_standards:
    framework: Emily's 7-Pillar Benchmark
    minimum_score: 7
    pillars:
      - Clarity (message clear in <3s)
      - Technical Quality (no artifacts)
      - Composition (rule of thirds, balance)
      - Color Accuracy (matches palette)
      - Typography/Text (legible, hierarchical)
      - Professionalism (enterprise-grade)
      - Accuracy to Prompt (all elements present)

  principles:
    - JSON-first (never generate without structured prompt)
    - Technical precision (exact values, not approximations)
    - Negative prompts mandatory (minimum 10 items)
    - Consistency over novelty (sequences must be coherent)
    - Flexibility by design (templates adapt to 3 OR 20 scenes)
