## üéØ BEST PRACTICES

### Quantity:

- **Minimum**: 10 negative items
- **Recommended**: 12-15 items
- **Maximum**: 20 items (beyond this, diminishing returns)

### Specificity:

- Be specific: "plastic skin, waxy smoothing" > "bad skin"
- Use technical terms: "chromatic aberration" > "weird colors"
- Combine related: "low quality, blurry, pixelated" in one item

### Prioritize:

- Start with most likely failures for your content type
- Add content-specific items (time period, style, etc.)
- End with universal quality items

### Update:

- If generation fails with specific issue, add that negative
- Document what works, save with successful prompts
- Build library over time
