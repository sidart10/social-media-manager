## Final Post

In 2015, the Big 4 cloud providers spent $24B on infrastructure.

In 2025, they'll spend $315B.

What changed? AI stopped being software.

Here's what $315B in hyperscaler spending tells us about where AI infrastructure is heading:

**The Numbers:**
• Amazon/AWS: $100B (8.3x growth)
• Microsoft/Azure: $80B (20x growth)
• Google/GCP: $75B (15x growth)
• Meta: $60B (20x growth)

This isn't about buying more servers. It's a fundamental shift in how companies view AI.

**The Shift:**

Traditional software = operational expense (pay per seat, rent monthly)
AI infrastructure = capital expenditure (own the compute, build the capability)

When your engineers burn 50k tokens/day using Claude Code or Cursor, your CFO thinks it's a software subscription.

It's actually infrastructure. Like bandwidth. Like storage. Like compute.

**Why This Matters:**

Token economics mirror infrastructure costs, not SaaS pricing. Netflix learned this early—invested $150M in AI infrastructure, now generates $1B+ annually from personalized recommendations.

That's a 6.7x ROI. And it compounds over time.

Most companies are still renting AI tools. The winners are building AI infrastructure.

**The Technical Reality:**

AI agents (like Claude Code) don't run like traditional apps. They need:
• Persistent sandbox environments
• File system access
• High compute for multi-hour workflows
• Runtime isolation

Every AI agent needs its own "digital computer." That's infrastructure, not software.

**The Paradox:**

DeepSeek was supposed to crash AI infrastructure spending with more efficient models. Instead, hyperscaler capex jumped 16% above forecasts.

Why? The Jevons Paradox—increased efficiency drives MORE demand for computing power, not less. Better AI = more use cases = more infrastructure needed.

**Current State:**

• AI workloads now account for 36-40% of all server revenue
• Accelerated servers (GPUs) dominate hyperscaler spending
• Custom chips (Google TPUs, AWS Trainium, Microsoft Maia) competing with NVIDIA
• Cloud spending grew 22% YoY in Q2 2025 to $95.3B

**The Strategic Question:**

Should your company build AI infrastructure or rent it?

Depends on:
• Scale of AI usage
• Long-term cost trajectory
• Competitive advantage from ownership
• Infrastructure expertise

But one thing is clear: AI has moved from the software budget to the infrastructure budget.

If you're still treating AI spending as OpEx instead of CapEx, your finance team needs to reconsider.

The $315B question every CTO is asking: When do we stop renting and start building?
