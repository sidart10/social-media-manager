In 2015, the Big 4 spent $24B on infrastructure. In 2025, they'll spend $315B.

AI stopped being software.

Amazon: 8x increase. Microsoft: 20x. Google: 15x. Meta: 20x.

These aren't normal growth curves. Something fundamental shifted.

Here's the thing: AI infrastructure isn't following the SaaS playbook anymore. It's following the electrification playbook from the 1920s.

Companies building "AI plants" the same way they once built power plants. Why? They realized ownership beats rental for foundational tech.

The evidence:

**Token economics replacing seat-based pricing**

Claude Code agents burning 50k+ tokens/day aren't "software subscriptions"—they're metered infrastructure, like bandwidth or storage.

Your CFO probably still thinks it's OpEx. It should be CapEx.

**Accelerated servers = 36-40% of total server revenue**

AI workloads aren't a side project. They're the main event. Q3 2024 saw 82% YoY increase in hyperscale data center capex—driven entirely by AI infrastructure.

**The Jevons Paradox in action**

DeepSeek was supposed to crash infrastructure spending by making models more efficient. Instead, hyperscaler capex jumped 16% above forecasts.

Why? Efficiency doesn't reduce demand—it unlocks new use cases.

More efficient AI = more AI usage = more infrastructure needed.

Don't get me wrong—this isn't about buying GPUs for the sake of it.

It's about recognizing that AI agents need persistent compute environments (sandboxes, file systems, runtime) to function. They're digital workers. Every worker needs a computer.

The companies treating AI as rented tooling will hit a ceiling.

The ones building AI infrastructure will compound value over time.
