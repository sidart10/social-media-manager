    "text": "In 2015, the Big 4 cloud providers spent $24B on infrastructure.\n\nIn 2025, they'll spend $315B.\n\nWhat changed? AI stopped being software.\n\nHere's what $315B in hyperscaler spending tells us about where AI infrastructure is heading:\n\n**The Numbers:**\n• Amazon/AWS: $100B (8.3x growth)\n• Microsoft/Azure: $80B (20x growth)\n• Google/GCP: $75B (15x growth)\n• Meta: $60B (20x growth)\n\nThis isn't about buying more servers. It's a fundamental shift in how companies view AI.\n\n**The Shift:**\n\nTraditional software = operational expense (pay per seat, rent monthly)\nAI infrastructure = capital expenditure (own the compute, build the capability)\n\nWhen your engineers burn 50k tokens/day using Claude Code or Cursor, your CFO thinks it's a software subscription.\n\nIt's actually infrastructure. Like bandwidth. Like storage. Like compute.\n\n**Why This Matters:**\n\nToken economics mirror infrastructure costs, not SaaS pricing. Netflix learned this early—invested $150M in AI infrastructure, now generates $1B+ annually from personalized recommendations.\n\nThat's a 6.7x ROI. And it compounds over time.\n\nMost companies are still renting AI tools. The winners are building AI infrastructure.\n\n**The Technical Reality:**\n\nAI agents (like Claude Code) don't run like traditional apps. They need:\n• Persistent sandbox environments\n• File system access\n• High compute for multi-hour workflows\n• Runtime isolation\n\nEvery AI agent needs its own \"digital computer.\" That's infrastructure, not software.\n\n**The Paradox:**\n\nDeepSeek was supposed to crash AI infrastructure spending with more efficient models. Instead, hyperscaler capex jumped 16% above forecasts.\n\nWhy? The Jevons Paradox—increased efficiency drives MORE demand for computing power, not less. Better AI = more use cases = more infrastructure needed.\n\n**Current State:**\n\n• AI workloads now account for 36-40% of all server revenue\n• Accelerated servers (GPUs) dominate hyperscaler spending\n• Custom chips (Google TPUs, AWS Trainium, Microsoft Maia) competing with NVIDIA\n• Cloud spending grew 22% YoY in Q2 2025 to $95.3B\n\n**The Strategic Question:**\n\nShould your company build AI infrastructure or rent it?\n\nDepends on:\n• Scale of AI usage\n• Long-term cost trajectory\n• Competitive advantage from ownership\n• Infrastructure expertise\n\nBut one thing is clear: AI has moved from the software budget to the infrastructure budget.\n\nIf you're still treating AI spending as OpEx instead of CapEx, your finance team needs to reconsider.\n\nThe $315B question every CTO is asking: When do we stop renting and start building?",
