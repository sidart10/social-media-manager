## Recommendations for Your Content Strategy

### What to Replicate

**1. Interview Clips with Big Names**
- If you have access to tech leaders/founders, use those clips
- Tease controversial questions in captions
- Drive to long-form YouTube content

**2. News-Jack AI Product Launches**
- Cover major AI news within 24-48 hours
- Add your take/analysis (not just reporting)
- Use "just launched" urgency language

**3. Use Multiple Hooks in One Reel**
- List 3-5 topics you'll cover (like Varun's 55K reel)
- Broad appeal increases reach
- Works for podcast/interview teasers

**4. Create Visual Spectacle Content**
- "Imagine..." hooks work (F1 AI racing)
- Sci-fi concepts drive engagement
- Even sponsored content performs if visually interesting

**5. Contrarian Takes on AI Hype**
- "AI browsers have critical flaws" performs better than "AI browsers are amazing"
- Audience appreciates balanced perspective
- Creates more comments (algorithm boost)

### What to Avoid

**1. Generic Sponsored Content**
- Don't promote products outside your niche
- Oral-B toothbrush = off-brand (even with AI angle)
- Intel laptops = weak connection to core audience

**2. Educational Without Hook**
- Pure information dumps get lower engagement
- Need celebrity, controversy, or visual spectacle

**3. Vague Teasers Without Details**
- Some interview clips underperform if hook isn't specific enough
- "We talk about X" needs specificity

## Optimal Content Formula (Based on Data)

**Topics:** AI products, tech news, future applications
**Timing:** Within 24-48 hours of news breaking

Caption: "In my latest podcast, [Name] revealed [Specific Insight].
We also discussed [Topic 2], [Topic 3], and [Topic 4].
Full episode link in bio üëÜ"
```

### Medium-Engagement Recipe

**Hook:** "[Company] just [Action]" or "Imagine [Scenario]..."
**Format:** Tech news commentary or visual demonstration
**Caption:** Explain the tech + why it matters
**Topics:** AI applications, product launches, creative use cases
