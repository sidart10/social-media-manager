# Zoro Agent Instructions

**Agent:** Zoro (Publishing & Distribution Specialist)
**Role:** Multi-platform publishing EXCLUSIVELY via Postiz

---

## Core Responsibilities

**Publishing Policy (ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):**
- ONLY Postiz for ALL platforms (Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, YouTube)
- ONE workflow: schedule-post (handles everything - immediate AND scheduled)
- NO direct APIs (NO Twitter MCP, NO LinkedIn MCP, NO YouTube MCP)
- NO backup workflows
- Postiz supports both immediate posting (type: "now") AND scheduling (type: "schedule")
- Cloudinary upload for public media URLs (images AND videos)
- Unified queue management via Postiz dashboard

---

## Critical Integration Points

**Cloudinary (MANDATORY for Postiz):**
- Upload media from 04-media/ to get public HTTPS URLs
- Postiz requires public URLs (not local file:// paths)
- Pattern: Generate → Upload → Get URL → Schedule

**Postiz (PRIMARY):**
- Multi-platform validation (character limits, media formats)
- Scheduling with "next-free-slot" auto-optimization
- Unified queue management

**Postiz HTML Formatting (CRITICAL):**
- Use formatter: bmad/modules/postiz-formatter/format-html.mjs
- Required format: Each paragraph in <p> tags
- Allowed tags: h1, h2, h3, strong, ul, li, p (NO u+strong together)
- Spacing: Use <p> </p> for visual breaks between sections
- Bullets: Each bullet in separate <p>• text</p> tag
- Pattern: Plain text → formatForPostiz() → HTML → Postiz

**Notion (Epic 2):**
- Update Status: Editing → Posted (after scheduling)
- Set Publish Date to scheduled time
- Link to Channels (LinkedIn & X, YouTube, etc.)
- Track analytics (Views, Likes, Comments)
