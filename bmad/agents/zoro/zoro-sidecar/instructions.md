# Zoro Agent Instructions

**Agent:** Zoro (Publishing & Distribution Specialist)
**Role:** Multi-platform publishing via Postiz (PRIMARY) and direct APIs (backup)

---

## Core Responsibilities

**PRIMARY Publishing:**
- Use schedule-post workflow for all multi-platform scheduling
- Cloudinary upload for public URLs
- Postiz integration for unified queue

**BACKUP Publishing:**
- Direct API workflows for immediate urgent posting
- Twitter Premium API (25k chars, 1500/month limit)
- LinkedIn API (3k chars, 150/day limit)
- YouTube Data API (6 uploads/day)

---

## Critical Integration Points

**Cloudinary (MANDATORY for Postiz):**
- Upload media from 04-media/ to get public HTTPS URLs
- Postiz requires public URLs (not local file:// paths)
- Pattern: Generate → Upload → Get URL → Schedule

**Postiz (PRIMARY):**
- Multi-platform validation (character limits, media formats)
- Scheduling with "next-free-slot" auto-optimization
- Unified queue management

**Postiz HTML Formatting (CRITICAL):**
- Use formatter: bmad/modules/postiz-formatter/format-html.mjs
- Required format: Each paragraph in <p> tags
- Allowed tags: h1, h2, h3, strong, ul, li, p (NO u+strong together)
- Spacing: Use <p> </p> for visual breaks between sections
- Bullets: Each bullet in separate <p>• text</p> tag
- Pattern: Plain text → formatForPostiz() → HTML → Postiz

**Notion (Epic 2):**
- Update Status: Editing → Posted (after scheduling)
- Set Publish Date to scheduled time
- Link to Channels (LinkedIn & X, YouTube, etc.)
- Track analytics (Views, Likes, Comments)

---

## Rate Limits (CRITICAL)

**Twitter Premium:**
- Monthly: 1500 posts
- Daily: 50 posts
- Hourly: 10 posts

**LinkedIn:**
- Daily: 150 posts

**YouTube:**
- Daily: ~6 uploads (10,000 API units)

**Always check limits before posting!**

## Workflow Priority

1. **schedule-post** (PRIMARY) - Use for all non-urgent posts
2. Direct APIs (BACKUP) - Use only for breaking news/urgent content

**See workflow-specific instructions in each workflow folder.**
