<critical>The workflow execution engine is governed by: {project-root}/bmad/core/tasks/workflow.xml</critical>
<critical>You MUST have already loaded and processed: {project-root}/bmad/bmb/workflows/create-skill/workflow.yaml</critical>

<workflow>

<step n="0" goal="Understand skill purpose and requirements">
<action>Engage in collaborative discovery to understand what skill they want to create:

Ask open-ended questions to explore:
- What should this skill do? What problem does it solve?
- What tasks should trigger this skill?
- Is this a simple utility or complex domain expertise?
- Do they have existing methodologies in mind, or should we research?

Listen for clues about:
- Domain complexity (file operations vs content creation vs specialized knowledge)
- Whether proven methodologies exist (research-worthy domains)
- User's familiarity with the domain (novice needs more research)
- Scope (focused single task vs multi-capability skill)

Based on responses, assess:
- Simple utility: File operations, data formatting, basic transformations
- Complex domain: Content creation, marketing, creative processes, specialized expertise

Store assessment as {{skill_complexity}} (simple/complex)
</action>
</step>

<step n="1" goal="Decide research approach">
<action>Based on the {{skill_complexity}} assessment, present research options:

If skill is COMPLEX (content creation, marketing, specialized domains):
  Explain: "This is a {domain} skill. I can find proven methodologies and best practices before building it."

If skill is SIMPLE (utilities, formatting, basic operations):
  Explain: "This is a straightforward skill. Template-based creation will be sufficient."
</action>

<ask>Choose creation mode:

1. **Quick creation** (1-2 min) - Template-based with your input
2. **Research-enhanced** (4-6 min) - Find proven methodologies first using Exa + Firecrawl

Select mode [1/2]:
</ask>

<action>Store {{creation_mode}} as 'quick' or 'research'</action>
</step>

<step n="2" goal="Execute research phase" if="creation_mode == 'research'">
<action>Load research context from {research_context} to understand research best practices</action>

<action>Execute comprehensive research using Exa and Firecrawl:

**Research Strategy:**
1. Generate smart research queries from skill purpose
   - Primary query: "{domain} best practices proven methodologies"
   - Secondary query: "{domain} frameworks strategies techniques"
   - Tertiary query: "{domain} expert insights real-world examples"

2. Execute Exa neural search:
   - Use mcp__exa__search with numResults=10
   - Target: High-quality sources (blogs, documentation, case studies)
   - Focus: Proven methodologies, frameworks, expert insights

3. Scrape top 3-5 sources with Firecrawl:
   - Use mcp__firecrawl__firecrawl_scrape for detailed content
   - Extract: Methodologies, best practices, frameworks, examples
   - Clean and structure findings

4. Synthesize research findings:
   - Identify 2-4 core methodologies/frameworks
   - Extract key best practices (5-10 items)
   - Collect real-world examples (3-5 examples)
   - Note credible sources for citations

Present research summary:
- Methodologies found: {{methodology_1}}, {{methodology_2}}, etc.
- Best practices: {{practice_1}}, {{practice_2}}, etc.
- Sources: {{source_count}} credible sources analyzed
- Examples: {{example_count}} real-world examples collected

Store all findings for incorporation into skill
</action>

<action>Ask user to review research findings and confirm they look good before proceeding</action>
</step>

<step n="3" goal="Generate skill metadata">
<action>Generate skill name following Anthropic conventions:

**Naming Rules (from Anthropic):**
- Lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens only (no underscores, no spaces)
- Max 64 characters
- Use gerund form (verb+ing) for action skills: "analyzing-data", "creating-images", "generating-reports"
- Be specific, not generic: "analyzing-instagram-engagement" not "social-media"
- Descriptive and clear: Name should hint at purpose

Based on skill purpose, generate 2-3 name options:
- Option 1: {{name_option_1}} (recommended)
- Option 2: {{name_option_2}} (alternative)
- Option 3: {{name_option_3}} (alternative)

Show rationale for recommendation
</action>

<ask>Accept recommended name or suggest alternative?

Recommended: {{name_option_1}}

[accept / suggest alternative]:
</ask>

<action>Store final {{skill_name}} (validated against Anthropic rules)</action>

<action>Now select agent category dynamically:

Load agent manifest from {agent_manifest}
Parse CSV to extract agent names (column: name)

Present numbered list to user:
1. {{agent_1}} (e.g., "jarvis" - content intelligence skills)
2. {{agent_2}} (e.g., "ai-image-generator" - visual creation skills)
3. {{agent_3}} (e.g., "ai-video-agent" - video production skills)
... (all agents from manifest)
N. **standalone** (not tied to specific agent, general-purpose skill)

Explain: Skills are organized by agent category in .claude/skills/{category}/
- Jarvis skills: Content research, writing, voice matching
- AI Image skills: Image generation, design, visual production
- AI Video skills: Video generation, script production
- Standalone: General utilities, cross-agent capabilities
</action>

<ask>Which agent category should this skill belong to?

Enter number (1-N):
</ask>

<action>Store {{agent_category}} based on selection (agent name or "standalone")</action>

<action>Craft optimized description for Claude discovery:

**Description Requirements (Anthropic):**
- Max 1024 characters
- Must include WHAT the skill does
- Must include WHEN Claude should use it
- Include trigger keywords that match user queries
- Be specific with examples or capabilities

**Template Structure:**
"{what-it-does}. Use when {trigger-scenario-1}, {trigger-scenario-2}, or {trigger-scenario-3}. {key-capabilities-or-methodologies}."

**If researched:**
Include discovered methodologies and frameworks:
"{what-it-does} using {methodology-from-research}. Use when {triggers}. Includes {frameworks-found}, {best-practices-found}, and {pattern-names}."

**Example (researched):**
"Create engaging Instagram captions with hooks, storytelling, and CTAs using proven engagement patterns from viral content analysis. Use when writing Instagram posts, captions, or social media content. Includes hook formulas, optimal caption length (600-1200 chars), hashtag strategies (5-10 tags), and call-to-action frameworks."

Generate description with:
- Clear what (primary capability)
- Specific when triggers (3-5 scenarios)
- Methodologies if researched
- Keyword-rich for discovery
- Under 1024 characters

Present draft description with:
- Character count: {{char_count}}/1024
- Trigger keywords: {{extracted_keywords}}
- Rationale for phrasing choices
</action>

<ask>Review generated description:

"{{generated_description}}"

Triggers: {{trigger_keywords}}
Length: {{char_count}}/1024 chars

Good to proceed? [yes / edit / regenerate]:
</ask>

<action>Store final {{skill_description}} (user-approved)</action>
</step>

<step n="4" goal="Design file structure">
<action>Based on skill complexity and research results, recommend file structure:

**Simple skills (no research, basic functionality):**
```
{skill_name}/
└── SKILL.md
```

**Medium skills (some research or examples needed):**
```
{skill_name}/
├── SKILL.md
├── prompts/
│   └── generation-template.md
└── examples/
    └── sample-output.md
```

**Complex skills (deep research, multiple methodologies):**
```
{skill_name}/
├── SKILL.md
├── reference/
│   ├── methodology.md (researched frameworks)
│   ├── best-practices.md (synthesized insights)
│   └── sources.md (research citations)

├── examples/
│   └── real-world-examples.md (from research)
└── scripts/ (optional - if code helpers needed)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📝 Next Steps:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. **Restart Claude Code** to load the new skill
   - Skills are loaded at session start
   - New skills won't appear until restart

2. **Test automatic discovery** with this query:
   "{{test_query}}"

3. **Verify skill activates:**
   - Claude should say: "Using {{skill_name}} skill..."
   - Output should follow skill methodologies
   - If Claude doesn't mention skill, description may need tuning

4. **Refine if needed:**
   - If skill doesn't activate, adjust description triggers
   - Add more "use when" keywords
   - Make description more specific

Skill is ready to use! 🎉
