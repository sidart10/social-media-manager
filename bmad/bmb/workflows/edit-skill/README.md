# Edit Skill Workflow

Edit existing Claude Code skills while maintaining consistency across SKILL.md, supporting files, and all project manifests. Automatically discovers and updates all usage locations in workflows and agents.

## Purpose

This workflow ensures skill edits propagate correctly to:
- ‚úÖ SKILL.md and supporting files (reference/, prompts/, examples/, scripts/)
- ‚úÖ skill-manifest.csv (name, description, category, path)
- ‚úÖ files-manifest.csv (regenerated hashes for modified files)
- ‚úÖ **All usage locations** - workflows, agents, commands, docs that reference the skill
- ‚úÖ Category moves (relocating skills between agent directories)

**Without this workflow:** Manual edits create inconsistencies between skill content, manifests, and usage locations!

## How to Invoke

**Via BMad Builder:**
```
/bmad:bmb:workflows:edit-skill
```

**Or directly:**
```
workflow bmad/bmb/workflows/edit-skill
```

## What This Workflow Does

### Step-by-Step Process

**0. Load and Select Skill**
- Dynamically loads all skills from skill-manifest.csv
- Presents numbered list grouped by category
- User selects skill to edit
- Loads all skill files and metadata

**0b. Discover Usage Locations** (CRITICAL!)
- Searches entire codebase for skill references
- Finds usage in: agents (.md, .yaml), workflows (instructions.md), docs (README.md), commands
- Creates usage map with file paths and line numbers
- Shows user: "This skill is referenced in {{count}} locations"

**1. Determine Edit Scope**
- User selects what to edit:
  1. Name or Description (metadata) - Updates {{usage_count}} locations
  2. Instructions/Content (SKILL.md body)
  3. Add/Remove Supporting Files (structure)
  4. Change Agent Category (move skill) - Updates paths everywhere
  5. Update Research (re-run Exa + Firecrawl)
  6. Multiple changes

**2. Edit YAML Frontmatter** (if metadata change)
- Update name (re-validates Anthropic conventions)
- Update description (re-checks triggers, length)
- Warns about breaking changes ({{usage_count}} files affected)

**3. Edit SKILL.md Content** (if content change)
- Select sections to edit (When to Use, Instructions, Examples)
- Iterative refinement with approval
- Maintains quality standards

**4. Manage Supporting Files** (if structure change)
- Add new files (reference/, prompts/, examples/, scripts/)
- Edit existing supporting files
- Remove files (with confirmation, updates links)

**5. Optional Re-Research** (if updating knowledge)
- Runs Exa + Firecrawl for updated methodologies
- Merges with existing research (doesn't replace)
- Updates reference/sources.md with new citations

**6. Handle Category Move** (if agent_category changes)
- Moves entire skill directory to new category
- Updates all path references in manifests
- Preserves file integrity

**7. Update Usage Locations** (if name/category changed)
- **Updates ALL files that reference the skill:**
  - Agent definitions (workflows they call)
  - Workflow instructions (skill invocations)
  - Documentation (skill descriptions)
  - Slash commands (skill mentions)
- Shows diff for each file
- User approves changes
- Applies updates with Edit tool

**8. Move Skill Files** (if category changed)
- Creates new category directory if needed
- Moves all files to new location
- Verifies integrity, removes old directory

**9. Re-Validate**
- Runs same validation as create-skill
- Checks YAML, name, description, file structure
- Verifies all usage locations updated correctly

**10. Update Manifests**
- Updates skill-manifest.csv (name, description, category, path)
- Regenerates SHA-256 hashes for modified files
- Updates files-manifest.csv with new hashes
- Adds new files, removes deleted files

**11. Complete**
- Shows comprehensive diff (skill changes + usage updates)
- Lists all modified files
- Provides updated test query
- Explains restart requirement

## Expected Inputs

**User Provides:**
- Skill selection (from dynamic list)
- Edit scope selection
- Approval for metadata changes
- Content edits for sections
- Confirmation for high-impact changes (name, category)
- Approval for usage location updates

**Workflow Loads Automatically:**
- skill-manifest.csv (dynamic skill list)
- agent-manifest.csv (for category selection)
- All current skill files
- Usage map via codebase search

## Generated Outputs

### Skill Changes

**Metadata edits:**
- Updated YAML frontmatter (name, description)
- Re-validated against Anthropic standards

**Content edits:**
- Modified SKILL.md sections
- Updated supporting files

**Structure changes:**
- New files added (reference/, prompts/, examples/)
- Old files removed
- Files reorganized

**Category move:**
- Skill relocated to new agent directory
- All paths updated

### Usage Location Updates (CRITICAL!)

**Workflow instructions updated:**
```
Before: "Use post-writer skill to generate..."
After:  "Use creating-social-posts skill to generate..."
```

**Agent definitions updated:**
```
Before: Triggers Skills: old-skill-name
After:  Triggers Skills: new-skill-name
```

**Path references updated:**
```
Before: .claude/skills/jarvis/old-name/
After:  .claude/skills/standalone/new-name/
```

### Manifests Updated

**skill-manifest.csv:**
- Name, description, agent_category, path columns updated
- research_enhanced updated if re-research performed

**files-manifest.csv:**
- Hashes regenerated for all modified files
- New files added with hashes
- Removed files deleted from manifest
- Paths updated if category moved

### Comprehensive Tracking

- Original values preserved for comparison
- Diff shown for every change
- Complete change log generated
- Rollback possible (all original values known)

## Tool Requirements

**Required:**
- File system access (Read, Write, Edit, Bash)
- Grep (finding skill usage)

**Optional (re-research only):**
- Exa Search
- Firecrawl

## Validation

**Pre-Edit Validation:**
- Skill exists and is loadable
- Usage map complete and accurate

**Post-Edit Validation:**
- All Anthropic conventions maintained
- Usage locations updated correctly
- Manifests consistent with file state
- No broken references

## Next Steps After Editing

**If metadata changed (name/description):**
1. Restart Claude Code - Required for new metadata to load
2. Test with updated query - Verify new triggers work
3. Check usage locations - Ensure workflows still work

**If only content changed:**
1. Optional restart - Changes work in current session
2. Test improved behavior - Verify enhancements work

**If category moved:**
1. Restart required - New path must load
2. Verify workflows - Check all usage locations work
3. Test skill activation - Ensure discovery still works
