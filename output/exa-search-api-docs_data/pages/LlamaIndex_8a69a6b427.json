In this guide, we'll use Exa's LlamaIndex integration to:\n\n1. Specify Exa's Search and Retrieve Highlight Tool as a LlamaIndex retriever\n2. Set up an OpenAI Agent that uses this tool in its response generation\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step title=\"Pre-requisites and installation\">\n    Install the llama-index, llama-index core, llama-index-tools-exa libraries. OpenAI dependencies are within the core library, so we don't need to specify that.\n\nAlso ensure API keys are initialized properly. The following code uses the `EXA_API_KEY` as the relevant environment variable name.\n\n<Card title=\"Get your Exa API key\" icon=\"key\" horizontal href=\"https://dashboard.exa.ai/api-keys\" />\n  </Step>\n\n<Step title=\"Instantiate Exa tool\">\n    Import the relevant Exa integration library and instantiate LlamaIndex's `ExaToolSpec`.\n\n<Step title=\"Choose the Exa method to use\">\n    For this example, we are only interested in passing the [search\\_and\\_retrieve\\_highlights](./search) method to our agent, so we specify this using the `.to_tool_list`LlamaIndex method. We also pass `current_date`, a simple utility so our agent knows the current date.\n\n<Step title=\"Set up an OpenAI Agent and make Exa-powered requests\">\n    Set up the [OpenAIAgent](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/agent/Chatbot%5FSEC/), passing the filtered down toolset from above.\n\nWe can then use the chat method to interact with the agent.\n\n<Step title=\"Sample outputs\">\n    Output 1: Verbose output of agent operation\n\nOutput 2: Agent response\n\nAs you can see, the output generation is enriched with the context of our Exa Search query result!\n  </Step>\n</Steps>",
