Here are a few major use cases:\n\n* **Recruiters**: source potential candidates for any role (we all know Linkedin search is broken after all)\n  * **Sales teams**: source companies and points of contact that match your ICP. Watch hours of outbound research be done in minutes\n  * **Investors**: whether you're looking for your next target or doing diligence, Websets can be a powerful tool. Find companies, financial statements, reports and news.\n  * **Researchers**: find research papers, reports, news and more. No matter what you're researching.\n  * **Founder**: find competitors, tweet ideas, candidates, potential customers, potential investors and more.\n\nAnd more! We've seen thousands of different use cases.\n</Accordion>\n\n<Accordion title=\"What exactly does Websets do?\">\n  Websets helps you find lists of entities (e.g. companies, people, research\n  papers) that match the specific criteria you provide. It's not an all-purpose\n  Q\\&A engine, so stick to queries aimed at listing out or filtering by certain\n  attributes. Websets can find people, companies, financial reports, research\n  papers, articles, news, blogposts, tweets, reddit threads, Github repos, the\n  list goes on.\n</Accordion>\n\n<Accordion title=\"Why am I not getting any results?\">\n  Too many restrictive criteria. If your search is very narrow (e.g., \"Companies\n  in Antarctica that raised \\$1B in seed funding in 2025\"), it may be impossible\n  to find matches. You can try removing or broadening certain criteria and\n  searching again. Asking questions not meant for Websets (e.g. if you're asking\n  open ended questions such as \"How's the European economy doing in 2025?\" or\n  specific questions such as \"What's an EGOT?\")\n</Accordion>\n\n<Accordion title=\"How many results can I request in one webset?\">\n  You can request anywhere from 1 to 1000+ results (depending on your plan and\n  credit balance). However: Large requests (1000+ results) can take about an\n  hour or more to complete. Websets stops automatically if it can't find your\n  requested number of matching items before hitting its search limit (50Ã— your\n  requested size or 50,000 max).\n</Accordion>\n\n<Accordion title=\"Can I remove or tweak results?\">\n  Yes. On the results page, you can manually delete any entries that you don't\n  want to keep. If you see that the results aren't what you need, you can also\n  refine your criteria and try again.\n</Accordion>\n\n<Accordion title=\"How do credits and pricing work?\">\n  Free: 1,000 credits. Websets up to 25 results, with limited features.\n\nSubscription Core plan: \\$49/month - 8,000 credits per month\n\nPro plan: \\$449/month - 100,000 credits per month\n\nWe also have an Enterprise plan.\n\n10 credit = 1 all-green result in a generated webset. For example, if you generate a webset of 50 perfect matches, that uses 500 credits. Credits are also used for special features such as custom columns, requesting emails/contact information & alerts.\n\nTopping up credits: If you run out, you can contact your point person to purchase additional credits manually.\n</Accordion>\n\n<Accordion title=\"Why is my Webset taking a long time?\">\n  Large requests (especially 1000+ results) can take up to \\~1 hour. This is\n  normal because Websets scans a large volume of data. The more criteria, the\n  tougher it is to find those results. These types of searches are narrower and\n  can take longer as well You can monitor the progress in the left-hand panel,\n  where you'll see the job's status and any partial progress.\n</Accordion>\n\n<Accordion title=\"Where does Websets get its data?\">\n  Websets runs using the Exa API - a powerful search engine that combines\n  keyword and semantic search methods to find precise criteria. Websets collects\n  and aggregates data from publicly available sources (e.g., company websites,\n  press releases). It can validate different criteria using different data\n  sources. This ensures that we can find more matches, more accurately. The tool\n  surfaces the references (links) used, so you can check exactly which sources\n  informed each match.\n</Accordion>\n\n<Accordion title=\"Can I change my criteria after I've generated a full webset?\">\n  Absolutely. You can revise your original query or tweak the criteria from the\n  Search More button on the lower left hand side. You would then run a new\n  Webset which would consume new credits based on how many all-green results you\n  generate.\n</Accordion>\n\n<Accordion title=\"What if I still have more questions or need more credits?\">\n  Contact your account representative or point person if you need help,\n  additional credits, or have feedback about your results, or [hello@exa.ai](mailto:hello@exa.ai).\n</Accordion>",
