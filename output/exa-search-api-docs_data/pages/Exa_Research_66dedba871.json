You provide natural-language instructions (e.g. *\"Compare the hardware roadmaps of the top GPU manufacturers\"*) and an optional JSON Schema describing the output you want.\n\nUnder the hood, Exa agents perform multiple steps:\n\n1. **Planning** – Your natural-language `instructions` are parsed by an LLM that decomposes the task into one or more research steps.\n\n2. **Searching** – Specialized search agents issue semantic and keyword queries to Exa's search engine, continuously expanding and refining the result set until they can fulfil the request.\n\n3. **Reasoning & synthesis** – Reasoning models combine facts across sources and return structured JSON (if you provide `outputSchema`) or a detailed markdown report.\n\nBecause tasks are **asynchronous**, you submit a request and immediately receive a `researchId`. You can [poll the request](/reference/research/get-a-task) until it is complete or failed, or [list all tasks](/reference/research/list-tasks) to monitor progress in bulk.\n\n* **Be explicit** – Clear, scoped instructions lead to faster tasks and higher-quality answers. You should describe (1) what information you want (2) how the agent should find that information and (3) how the agent should compose it's final report.\n* **Keep schemas small** – 1-5 root fields is the sweet spot. If you need more, create multiple tasks.\n* **Use enums** – Tight schema constraints improve accuracy and reduce hallucinations.\n\nThe Research API offers two advanced agentic researcher models that break down your instructions, search the web, extract and reason over facts, and return structured answers with citations.\n\n* **exa-research** (default) adapts to the difficulty of the task, using more or less compute for individual steps. Recommended for most use cases.\n* **exa-research-pro** maximizes quality by using the highest reasoning capability for every step. Recommended for the most complex, multi-step research tasks.\n\nHere are typical completion times for each model:\n\n| Model            | p50 (seconds) | p90 (seconds) |\n| ---------------- | ------------- | ------------- |\n| exa-research     | 45            | 90            |\n| exa-research-pro | 90            | 180           |\n\nThe Research API now uses **variable usage-based pricing**. You are billed based on how much work and reasoning the research agent does.\n\n<Note>You are ONLY charged for tasks that complete successfully.</Note>\n\n| Operation            | exa-research      | exa-research-pro   | Notes                                                |\n| -------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |\n| **Search**           | \\$5/1k searches   | \\$5/1k searches    | Each unique search query issued by the agent         |\n| **Page read**        | \\$5/1k pages read | \\$10/1k pages read | One \"page\" = 1,000 tokens from the web               |\n| **Reasoning tokens** | \\$5/1M tokens     | \\$5/1M tokens      | Specific LLM tokens used for reasoning and synthesis |\n\n**Example:**\\\nA research task with `exa-research` that performs 6 searches, reads 20 pages of content, and uses 1,000 reasoning tokens would cost:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{rl}\n& \\$0.03 \\text{ (6 searches × \\$5/1000)} \\\\\n+ & \\$0.10 \\text{ (20 pages × \\$5/1000)} \\\\\n+ & \\$0.005 \\text{ (1{,}000 reasoning tokens × \\$5/1{,}000{,}000)} \\\\\n\\hline\n& \\$0.135\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nFor `exa-research-pro`, the same task would cost:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{rl}\n& \\$0.03 \\text{ (6 searches × \\$5/1000)} \\\\\n+ & \\$0.20 \\text{ (20 pages × \\$10/1000)} \\\\\n+ & \\$0.005 \\text{ (1{,}000 reasoning tokens × \\$5/1{,}000{,}000)} \\\\\n\\hline\n& \\$0.235\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\n### Competitive Landscape Table\n\nCompare the current flagship GPUs from NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel and extract pricing, TDP, and release date.\n\n### Market Size Estimate\n\nEstimate the total global market size (USD) for battery recycling in 2030 with a clear methodology.\n\n### Timeline of Key Events\n\nBuild a timeline of major OpenAI product releases from 2015 – 2023.\n\n<AccordionGroup>\n  <Accordion title=\"Who is the Research API for?\">\n    Product teams, analysts, researchers, and anyone who needs **structured answers** that require reading multiple web sources — without having to build their own search + scraping + LLM pipeline.\n  </Accordion>\n\n<Accordion title=\"How is this different from the /answer endpoint?\">\n    `/answer` is designed for **single-shot Q\\&A**. The Research API handles\n    **long-running, multi-step investigations**. It's suitable for tasks that\n    require complex reasoning over web data.\n  </Accordion>\n\n<Accordion title=\"How long do tasks take?\">\n    Tasks generally complete in 20–40 seconds. Simple tasks that can be solved\n    with few searches complete faster, while complex schema's targeting niche\n    subjects may take longer.\n  </Accordion>\n\n<Accordion title=\"What are best practices for writing instructions?\">\n    Be explicit about the objective and any constraints - Specify the **time\n    range** or **types of sources** to consult if important - Use imperative verbs\n    (\"Compare\", \"List\", \"Summarize\") - Keep it under 4096 characters\n  </Accordion>\n\n<Accordion title=\"How large can my output schema be?\">\n    You must have ≤ 8 root fields. It must not be more than 5 fields deep.\n  </Accordion>\n\n<Accordion title=\"What happens if my schema validation fails?\">\n    If your schema is not valid, an error will surface *before the task is\n    created* with a message about what is invalid. You will not be charged for\n    such requests.\n  </Accordion>\n</AccordionGroup>",
