When you create a webhook, you choose which events you want to know about and where to send the notifications.\n\nWhen an event happens, Exa sends an HTTP POST request to your webhook URL with:\n- Event details (type, time, ID)\n- Full data of what triggered the event\n- A signature to verify the request came from Exa\n\nThe webhook starts as `active` and begins getting notifications right away. You'll get a secret key for checking webhook signatures - save this safely as it's only shown once when you create the webhook.",
