You may be interested in the live version of the page, which our `livecrawl` parameter can help with.\n\nHere are all livecrawl options and their behaviors:\n\n| Option        | Crawl Behavior   | Cache Fallback              | Best For                                               |\n| ------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |\n| `\"always\"`    | Always crawls    | Never falls back            | Real-time data (news, stock prices, live events)       |\n| `\"preferred\"` | Always crawls    | Falls back on crawl failure | Production apps needing fresh content with reliability |\n| `\"fallback\"`  | Only if no cache | Uses cache first            | Balanced speed and freshness                           |\n| `\"never\"`     | Never crawls     | Always uses cache           | Maximum speed, historical/static content               |\n\n## When LiveCrawl Isn't Necessary\n\nCached data is sufficient for many queries, especially for historical topics like \"What were the major causes of World War II?\" or educational content such as \"How does photosynthesis work?\" These subjects rarely change, so reliable cached results can provide accurate information quickly.\n\nUsing `\"always\"` ensures you get the freshest content. If you're tracking Apple's latest releases, you'll want a live view of their homepage:\n\nOutput without LiveCrawl: Results here are slightly dated, mentioning a fall release (later in the year)\n\nOutput with LiveCrawl (as at Oct 30 2024): Now we see contents talking about Apple's upcoming specific release on November 11th\n\n### Production Applications\n\nUsing `\"preferred\"` provides fresh content with fallback reliability. This is ideal for production applications:\n\nThis will try to get the freshest content available, but if live crawling fails (due to website downtime, network issues, etc.), it falls back to cached content instead of failing entirely. This makes it ideal for production applications.",
