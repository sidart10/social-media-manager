It's powered by the Exa search engine.\n\nExamples of queries you can make with `exa-code`:\n\n* use Exa search in python and make sure content is always livecrawled\n* use correct syntax for vercel ai sdk to call gpt-5 nano asking it how are you\n\n**Works with Cursor and Claude Code!** Use the HTTP-based configuration format:\n\nInstalling Exa MCP like below will install Exa web search as well as `exa-code`. To maximize performance, be sure to leave *only* `exa-code` turned on in your MCP client.\n\nYou can also use `exa-code` through [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/exa) without an Exa API key.\n\nExa MCP Server enables AI assistants like Claude to perform real-time web searches through the Exa Search API, allowing them to access up-to-date information from the internet.
