  "content": "Source: https://docs.exa.ai/changelog/auto-keyword-score-deprecation\n\nWe're deprecating relevance scores in Auto and Keyword search types due to architectural improvements. Scores will remain available in Neural search.\n\n**Date: July 21, 2025**\n\nWe're launching a big update to Auto search in our API. The new system cannot create useful scores for results. Because of this, we're removing scores from Auto and Keyword search types.\n\n<Info>\n  Scores in Neural search results will remain unchanged and continue to work exactly as before.\n</Info>\n\nPreviously, all search types (Auto, Keyword, and Neural) returned relevance scores - a number from 0 to 1 representing similarity between the query and each result. With our new Auto search architecture, we can no longer generate meaningful scores for Auto and Keyword search results.\n\nThe search functionality works exactly the same way as it did before - you'll still get the same high-quality results, just without the `score` field in the response.\n\n## What This Means for You\n\n1. **Auto search**: The `score` field will no longer be returned in search results\n2. **Keyword search**: The `score` field will no longer be returned in search results\n3. **Neural search**: Scores continue to work exactly as before with no changes\n4. **Migration needed**: If your application relies on scores from Auto or Keyword search, you should migrate as soon as possible\n\n## How to Update Your Code\n\nIf you currently use scores from Auto or Keyword search, here is what you can do:\n\n### Remove Score Dependencies\n\n```python Python theme={null}",
