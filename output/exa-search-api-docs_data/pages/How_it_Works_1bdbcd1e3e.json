When you create a Webset, it automatically starts searching and verifying results based on your criteria. Let's dive into each part of the process.\n\n## Creating Your First Search\n\nThe process starts when you [create a Webset](/websets/api/websets/create-a-webset). Here's how it flows:\n\n### 1. Initial Request\n\nStart by providing a search configuration:\n\nYou can optionally specify:\n\n* An `entity.type` to define what you're looking for\n* Custom `criteria` for verification\n* `enrichments` to extract specific data points\n* `metadata` for your own tracking\n\n### 2. Webset Creation\n\nWhen your request is received:\n\n1. A new Webset is created with status `running`\n2. A `webset.created` event is emitted\n3. The search process begins automatically\n\n### 3. Search Process\n\nThe search flows through several stages:\n\n1. **Initialization**\n\n* A new WebsetSearch is created\n   * Status is set to `running`\n   * `webset.search.created` event is emitted\n\n2. **Discovery & Verification**\n\n* The system starts retrieving results leveraging Exa Search and verifies each one\n   * Items that pass verification and match your search criteria are automatically added to your Webset\n   * Each new item triggers a `webset.item.created` event\n   * Items are immediately available through the [list endpoint](/websets/api/websets/items/list-all-items-for-a-webset)\n\n3. **Enrichment** (if configured)\n\n* Each item is processed through specified enrichments\n   * `webset.item.enriched` events are emitted as results come in\n   * Enrichment results are added to the item's data\n\n4. **Completion**\n   * When the search finds all items, its status changes to `completed`\n   * A `webset.search.completed` event is emitted\n   * If no other operations are running, you'll receive a `webset.idle` event\n\n### Accessing Results\n\nYou can access your data throughout the process:\n\n1. **Real-time Access**\n\n* Use the list endpoint to paginate through items\n   * Listen for item events (`webset.item.created` and `webset.item.enriched`) to process results as they arrive\n\n2. **Bulk Export**\n   * Available once the Webset becomes `idle`\n   * Includes all items with their content, verifications and enrichments\n   * Useful for processing the complete dataset\n\n## Running Additional Searches\n\nYou can [create additional searches](/websets/api/websets/searches/create-a-search) on the same Webset at any time. Each new search:\n\n* Follows the same event flow as the initial search\n* Can run in parallel with other enrichment operations (not other searches for now)\n* Maintains its own progress tracking\n* Contributes to the overall Webset state\n\n### Control Operations\n\nManage your searches with:\n\n* [Cancel specific searches](/websets/api/websets/searches/cancel-a-running-search)\n* [Cancel all operations](/websets/api/websets/cancel-a-running-webset)\n\n## Up-to-date Websets using Monitors\n\n**[Monitors](/websets/api/monitors/create-a-monitor)** allow you to automatically keep your Websets updated with fresh data on a schedule, creating a continuous flow of updates without manual intervention.\n\n* **Search behavior**: Automatically run new searches to find fresh content matching your criteria. New items are added to your Webset with automatic deduplication.\n\n* **Refresh behavior**: Update existing items by refreshing their content from source URLs or re-running specific enrichments to capture data changes.\n\nSet your update frequency with:\n\n* **Cron Expression**: A valid Unix cron expression with 5 fields that triggers at most once per day\n* **Timezone**: Any IANA timezone (defaults to `Etc/UTC`)\n\n### Example: Weekly Monitor for Series A Funded Companies",
