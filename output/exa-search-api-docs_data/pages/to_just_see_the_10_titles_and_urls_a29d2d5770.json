As a bonus specifically for companies data, specifying `category=\"company\"` in the SDK will search across a curated, larger companies dataset - if you're interested in this, let us know at [hello@exa.ai](mailto:hello@exa.ai)!\n\nNow that we have 10 companies we want to dig into further, let’s do some research on each of these companies.\n\n## Finding additional info for each company\n\nNow let's get more information by finding additional webpages about each company. To do this, we're going to do a keyword search of each company's URL. We're using keyword because we want to find webpages that exactly match the company we're inputting. We can do this with the `search_and_contents` function, and specify `type=\"keyword\"` and `num_results=5`. This will give me 5 websites about each company.",
