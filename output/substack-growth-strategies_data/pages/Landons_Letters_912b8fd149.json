Just a blank page and a blinking cursor.\n\nWhere would you even begin?\n\nI asked myself the same question after growing from 0 to 3,700 subscribers. Along the way, I’ve tested a lot of features, refined my strategies, and learned what actually moves the needle.\n\nThis is my updated 2025 guide to growing on Substack from scratch—the way I’d do it if I had to start over today.\n\nThe original guide was posted in September 2024—in the last 6 Months, I’ve gone from 1,773 to 3,680 subscribers—107.6% increase.\n\nI treat Substack like a video game.\n\nWhen you start playing, you're at Level 1. No skills, no special abilities—just pressing buttons and hoping something works.\n\nIt’s where everyone begins.\n\nBut the more you play, the more you figure things out. You unlock new skills, gain experience, and level up. Eventually, you increase the difficulty—because that’s where the best rewards are.\n\nSubstack works the same way.\n\nEvery creator starts at zero subscribers. No audience. No momentum. Just posting into the void. But the people who treat it like a game—who stick with it and level up strategically—see the biggest growth.\n\nAnd here’s the best part: You don’t need to rush to the hardest level.\n\nNo one starts at the top.\n\nThe first 6 months on Substack aren’t about growth—they’re about figuring it out:\n\nDeveloping your voice.\n\nFinding what resonates.\n\nRefining your skills as a writer.\n\nMost people rush this phase. Big mistake.\n\nLike any game, if you try to skip levels, you get overwhelmed and quit. Instead, progress one level at a time—at your own pace.\n\nPost 1x Weekly Newsletter.\n\nNothing else. No Notes. No comments. No pressure.\n\nYour only goal at this level: Build the habit.\n\nPost 1x Weekly Newsletter.\n\nPost 3-5 Weekly Notes.\n\nNotes introduce you to new readers—without overwhelming your writing schedule.\n\nPost 1x Weekly Newsletter.\n\nAt this level, you start engaging with others—because Substack is a community.\n\nPost 1x Weekly Newsletter.\n\nPost 1-3x Daily Notes.\n\nPost 5-10x Daily Comments.\n\nCasual Collaborations.\n\nNow you’re consistently visible. You show up. People recognize your name. They begin sharing your work.\n\nPost 1-2x Weekly Newsletter.\n\nPost 1-3x Daily Notes.\n\nPost 10x Daily Comments.\n\nGenerate 'Recommendations'.\n\nOptimize Your Publication Theme.\n\nLeverage Substack To Build Email List.\n\nAt this level, you aren’t just playing—you’re competing. Substack becomes a core component of your business.\n\nThese ‘bonuses’ can be added anytime, if and when you choose.\n\nMost people fail on Substack for one simple reason: they burn out.\n\nThey think more is better—more posts, more Notes, more engagement. But just like starting a video game on Hardcore Mode, they get overwhelmed and quit because it’s too hard and not fun.\n\nHere’s what burnout looks like:\n\nStruggling to post consistently.\n\nFeeling like you should be doing more.\n\nRunning out of ideas.\n\nLosing motivation to write.\n\nThe secret to long-term success?\n\nStart small, stay consistent, and only level up when it feels almost too easy.\n\nThis isn’t about “hustling” your way to growth. It’s about finding your sustainable pace.\n\nHow to Know If You’re Doing Too Much?\n\nYou feel drained instead of excited after writing.\n\nYou’re forcing yourself to post instead of looking forward to it.\n\nYou begin to dread logging into Substack.\n\nWhen that happens? Dial it back.\n\nYou don’t need to do everything—you just need to do what’s sustainable.\n\nI played on Beginner Mode for 10 months before leveling up.\n\nMost people don’t believe me when I say that.\n\nAfter releasing my first guide, I got messages from people feeling “stuck,” wondering if they should push harder—or worse, trying to start on Hardcore Mode from day one.\n\nHere’s what I tell them:\n\nIf it still feels hard, you don’t need to level up.\n\nIf it feels too easy, now’s the time.\n\nThere’s no prize for moving faster. Progress at your own pace.\n\nThe best creators I know don’t rush. They build sustainable habits first, then scale up when they’re ready.\n\nBefore increasing difficulty, ask yourself:\n\nAm I publishing my newsletter consistently? (Without stress or missed weeks?)\n\nDo I have a writing rhythm that feels natural—not forced?\n\nAm I regularly getting engagement (comments, replies, shares)?\n\nDo I feel confident in my current posting flow?\n\nAm I excited to add more, rather than overwhelmed by the idea?\n\nIf you answered ‘yes’ to at least 4 of these, you’re ready.\n\nIf not? Stay where you are.\n\nThere’s nothing wrong with mastering one level before moving up.\n\nInstead of trying to “do it all,” I focused on just three core strategies:\n\nNewsletters/Posts (Trust & Engagement)\n\nNotes (Visibility & Discovery)\n\nComments (Community & Networking)\n\nEverything else? Optional.\n\nI pick and choose like a growth menu. Sometimes pushing, sometimes pulling back.\n\nIf you’re feeling overwhelmed, pause. There’s nothing wrong with staying at Level 1 longer than someone else.\n\nYour only real goal? Stay in the game.\n\nMore on my “No-Hustle” Growth Strategies Here.\n\nYour newsletter is the foundation of your Substack.\n\nIf you do nothing else—send a weekly newsletter.\n\nIt’s what people subscribe for. It builds trust. It deepens connection.\n\nNewsletters go directly to inboxes—unlike Notes, which rely on the algorithm.\n\nIt’s where long-term readers are built.\n\nIt’s your best monetization channel down the line.\n\nWhat to Focus On (Especially Early On):\n\nConsistency over perfection—1x per week.\n\nClarity over complexity—write like you talk.\n\nEngagement over performance—don’t chase virality, chase connection.\n\nStart here: If you’re not publishing a newsletter (or ‘long-form’ posts) consistently, nothing else will move the needle. I will explain why I start with Posts over Notes shortly.\n\nNewsletters build trust. Notes build visibility.\n\nThink of Notes as your organic marketing channel inside Substack. They introduce you to new readers, keep you top-of-mind, and drive your growth.\n\nNotes are discovery-focused—they help people find you.\n\nThe Substack algorithm amplifies Notes, but not newsletters.\n\nLow effort, high impact—quick posts can get you seen.\n\nWhen ready, post 3-5 Notes per week (start there, scale up).\n\nMix value + personality—share insights, quick thoughts, and lessons.\n\nKeep it conversational—Notes feel like social media, not long-form.\n\nIf you want faster growth, Notes are a must. They introduce you to new readers without you having to do extra promotion.\n\nComments are your low-effort visibility hack.\n\nEvery comment you leave is a free visibility for your work. People notice thoughtful contributions, click your profile, and some subscribe—without you ever having to \"sell\" yourself.\n\nHigh visibility: You’re engaging where readers already are.\n\nZero friction: No need to create new content—just interact.\n\nRelationship-driven: Comments open doors to collabs, recommendations, and networking.\n\nHow to Do It Without Wasting Time:\n\nComment in the margins of life. Waiting at Starbucks? Drop a comment.\n\nBookmark 5-10 people in your niche and engage with them consistently.\n\nAvoid “great post!”—add value. Be specific, be insightful.\n\nIf you’re too busy to write more, try commenting more. It’s one of the simplest ways to get in front of new readers after your foundation is established.\n\nWhy build an audience from scratch when you can borrow one?\n\nCollabs—whether through guest posts, or joint lives—put you in front of a warm audience that already trusts someone else.\n\nYou tap into existing trust. Their audience now sees you as valuable.\n\nImmediate exposure boost. No waiting for an audience to build.\n\nIt scales effortlessly. One great collab can bring thousands of views.\n\nHow to Start (Even If You’re Small):\n\nComment & engage first—build rapport before pitching.\n\nOffer value. Don’t ask to “guest post”—pitch a win-win idea.\n\nStart with peers, not A-listers. You’ll get better responses.\n\nAsk. Sometimes that’s all it takes.\n\nOne collab can do more for growth than multiple posts. Prioritize relationship-building, and collabs will come naturally.\n\nImagine getting new subscribers without posting anything.\n\nThat’s the power of Substack Recommendations. When someone recommends your publication, their readers see you—and many subscribe.\n\nZero effort required. Once acquired, they work passively.\n\nHigh-trust growth. People trust the creators they follow—if they recommend you, it’s like a warm intro.\n\nCompounds over time. The more you get, the more they snowball.\n\nHow to Get More Recommendations:\n\nRecommend others first. Some will return the favor.\n\nEngage with Substacks you admire. Build genuine relationships. Ask.\n\nCreate Recommendation-worthy content.\n\nIt’s the easiest way to get new subscribers without extra work.\n\nYour Substack should be clear, easy to navigate, and optimized for growth.\n\nYour homepage = your business card. Make it easy for readers to explore.\n\nStrategic links drive action. Readers should instinctively know where to go next.\n\nBetter design = more leads and sales. If your Substack is optimized, you can begin generating leads and sales every time they visit your page.\n\nQuick Wins to Improve Your Theme:\n\nNavigation Links: Add lead magnets, resources, or key categories to your navigation bar.\n\nHomepage Optimization: Feature your best posts, offers, or a “Start Here” section.\n\nWelcome Email: Set up an email that introduces you, shares your top content, and directs new subscribers to your best work.\n\nPinned “Start Here” Post: Use a pinned post to guide new visitors, highlight your best work, and offer a clear next step (like subscribing or buying).\n\nCTA Integration: Naturally include links within your posts (e.g., related content, lead magnets, offers) without being spammy.\n\nYour Substack should feel like a well-designed website. Small changes = big impact.\n\nFor a step-by-step guide on optimizing your theme for leads and sales, click here.\n\nThink of these like bonus upgrades in a video game.\n\nYou don’t need them to succeed—but if you add them at the right time, they can supercharge your growth, engagement, and monetization.\n\nThese features aren’t required to build a thriving Substack. You can grow just fine by sticking to the core strategies. But if you’re ready to experiment, these Power-Ups can make everything easier, faster, and more fun.\n\nUse them when it makes sense. Ignore them if it doesn’t. Your game, your pace.\n\nMost people think Substack monetization = paid subscriptions.\n\nThat’s only one option. And for most new writers, it’s not the best first step.\n\nYou can monetize early—even with a small audience, hindering growth.\n\nMultiple revenue streams = long-term sustainability.\n\nPaid newsletters aren’t the only way. Many creators leverage Substack to sell products, services, and digital assets.\n\nHow to Monetize (Beyond Paid Newsletters):\n\nBuild an Email List First – Use Substack to grow your audience, then monetize via coaching, courses, or products.\n\nStrategic Linking – Add custom links in your navigation bar, homepage, and posts to drive traffic to offers.\n\nLeverage Recommendations – More recommendations = more subscribers = more monetization opportunities.\n\nUse Substack Chat & Lives – These features build deeper relationships, survey your audience, and drive direct sales.\n\nHere are 19 Ways To Monetize Your Substack—Even If You Think You Have Nothing to Sell.\n\nSubstack Lives are one of the most underrated features for engagement and visibility.\n\nWhen you go live, Substack sends email notifications to your audience—bringing people in without relying on the algorithm.\n\nDirect inbox exposure. Lives get automatic email ‘promotion’ to your subscribers.\n\nDeepens audience connection. Face-to-face interaction builds stronger loyalty.\n\nCollaborations = Instant New Eyeballs. Go live with another creator and double your reach.\n\nHow to Use Substack Lives Effectively:\n\nHost a Q&A or teaching session. Give readers a reason to show up live.\n\nGo live with another Substack writer. Their audience gets notified, too.\n\nPromote replays and create clips. Not everyone will join live, but they’ll watch later.\n\nIf you want stronger engagement & growth—start experimenting with Lives.\n\nSubstack Chat is like having a direct text line to your subscribers.\n\nInstead of fighting for attention on social media, you can build a tight-knit community inside Substack.\n\nIt lands directly in subscribers’ notifications.\n\nCasual, unfiltered connection. No pressure—can be quick updates, polls, or thoughts.\n\nEngagement without overcommitting. A fast way to keep readers engaged between newsletters.\n\nHow to Use Chat Effectively:\n\nAsk questions & spark discussions. Get people talking.\n\nShare behind-the-scenes content. Give them a peek into your process.\n\nUse it to test ideas & validate topics. See what resonates before writing a full post or creating a product.\n\nIf you want a community without a Facebook Group, Substack Chat is a no-brainer.\n\nEver written a great post… and felt like it didn’t get the attention it deserved?\n\nYou’re not alone. Creating valuable content is only half the battle—getting it in front of the right audience is what truly fuels growth.\n\nThat’s where repurposing can come in. Instead of constantly creating from scratch, maximize what you’ve already written.\n\nI’ve gone hardcore with repurposing before—turning every article into YouTube videos, podcasts, and 3-5 short-form clips per day. It burned me out.\n\nBut my lazy repurposing strategy? That’s been a game-changer.\n\nMy “Lazy” Repurposing Strategy:\n\nShare long-form posts on Medium & LinkedIn. Set it and forget it—low effort, extra visibility.\n\nRepost key takeaways as Notes. Turns one idea into multiple touchpoints.\n\nLink all social media bios back to Substack. Simple way to capture new readers.\n\nOnly focus on where you already have an audience. If you’re big on LinkedIn, repurpose there. No need to be everywhere.\n\nI’ve gained 1,500+ views, 100 subscribers, and $632.06 in revenue from repurposing alone—without creating anything new.\n\nRepurposing takes time—not everyone needs to do it. But if you’re looking for low-effort growth, it could be an easy win.\n\nDon’t let your best ideas die after one post. Get more mileage from your work.\n\nStart with Posts, then scaffold on Notes.\n\nPosts or ‘long-form’ content builds trust and rapport with your audience. It is what they subscribe to receive. This content is a direct line to their email inbox.\n\nNotes or ‘short-form’ content builds awareness and increases visibility. Yes, it also builds trust and rapport, it is the content that grows our subscriber base.\n\nNotes are controlled by an algorithm—Posts aren’t.\n\nIt’s not a question of this or that. Optimal growth requires both. Publications that publish Posts but no Notes may struggle to grow. Publications that publish Notes but not Posts may struggle to build trust and monetize.\n\nMy recommendation: Start with Posts. Then add Notes.\n\nStart with quantity, then improve quality, repeat.\n\nIn the beginning, I believe it’s most important to build the habit. Consistently writing and consistently publishing. In my experience, quality is subjective—what one person thinks is a work of art is not to another. Focus on publishing, not perfection.\n\nIn this manner, the quantity is whatever cadence you choose. Doesn’t matter if it’s daily or weekly, the goal is building the habit. As the habit develops you shift your focus to incremental improvements in quality.\n\nThis was the approach I took and what I recommend to others.\n\nWhen I started on Substack in September 2023 I published 1 long-form post per week. Saturday mornings I would sit down with a Nitro Cold Brew, plug in my binaural beats, and write and publish my post.\n\nMy writing got better through repetition. And with time I had a desire to improve. Once my routine was set I began improving my headlines and titles. Then I improved the structure of my posts. Today, my focus is the “big idea” of my posts.\n\nQuality is a long-term journey. But it cannot be refined if we’re not putting in the repetitions and actively publishing. This is why my recommendation is: build the habit (quantity) and then refine the skill (quality).\n\nMost people burn out because they aim too high, too soon.\n\nInstead, shrink your habit until it’s impossible to fail.\n\nFor me? My MVH is putting my hands on the keyboard daily. Not writing 1,000 words. Not publishing every day. Just showing up.\n\nSome days, I write 1,500 words. Other days, just 47. But I never break the streak.\n\nHere’s how to create your own MVH:\n\nShrink it down. What’s the smallest possible version of your habit?\n\nMake it feel almost too easy. You should be able to do it on your worst day.\n\nLet consistency drive progress. Once the habit is set, leveling up is easy(er).\n\nSustainable growth beats sprinting and quitting. The key to winning is just staying in the game.\n\nIf you take nothing else from this guide, remember this:\n\nConsistency beats everything.\n\nSubstack growth isn’t about chasing hacks, going viral, or working 10x harder than everyone else. It’s about showing up, staying in the game, and leveling up at your own pace.\n\nEvery strategy in this guide works.\n\nBut they only work if you stick with them long enough to see results.\n\nIf you’re overwhelmed? Go back a level.\n\nIf you feel stuck? Slow down or do less, don’t quit.\n\nIf you’re growing? Keep going—but at a pace you can sustain.\n\nThis is a long game. The people who win are the ones who don’t burn out, don’t quit, and keep building—one step at a time.\n\nIf you skimmed, here’s everything in one place.\n\nLevel 1: Weekly newsletter. Start here.\n\nLevel 2: Add 3-5 Notes per week.\n\nLevel 3: Post daily Notes + casual comments.\n\nLevel 4: Engage with 5-10 daily comments + light collaborations.\n\nLevel 5: Go all in—daily Notes, comments, collaborations, and recommendations.\n\nSubstack Lives: Instant exposure + direct engagement.\n\nSubstack Chat: A direct line to your audience.\n\nMonetization: Beyond paid newsletters—products, services, etc.\n\nContent Repurposing: Get more mileage from your best ideas.\n\nQuantity → Quality: Publish consistently, then refine.\n\nMinimal Viable Habit (MVH): Keep your habit so small it’s impossible to fail.\n\nConsistency beats everything: The biggest advantage is staying in the game.\n\nFinal Step: Pick One & Take Action.\n\nDon’t try to do everything at once. Pick one strategy, implement it, and build from there.\n\nThe next level is waiting.\n\nIn Subliminal Selling, I’ll give you my straightforward 3-step process to pinpoint exactly what your readers want, create a profitable digital product with zero-cost tools, and make your first sale in record time.\n\nYour first dollar awaits.
