Imagine starting over on Substack today.

No subscribers. No audience. Just a blank page and a blinking cursor.

Where would you even begin?

I asked myself the same question after growing from 0 to 3,700 subscribers. Along the way, I’ve tested a lot of features, refined my strategies, and learned what actually moves the needle.

This is my updated 2025 guide to growing on Substack from scratch—the way I’d do it if I had to start over today.

The original guide was posted in September 2024—in the last 6 Months, I’ve gone from 1,773 to 3,680 subscribers—107.6% increase.

I treat Substack like a video game.

When you start playing, you're at Level 1. No skills, no special abilities—just pressing buttons and hoping something works.

It’s where everyone begins.

But the more you play, the more you figure things out. You unlock new skills, gain experience, and level up. Eventually, you increase the difficulty—because that’s where the best rewards are.

Substack works the same way.

Every creator starts at zero subscribers. No audience. No momentum. Just posting into the void. But the people who treat it like a game—who stick with it and level up strategically—see the biggest growth.

And here’s the best part: You don’t need to rush to the hardest level.

No one starts at the top.

The first 6 months on Substack aren’t about growth—they’re about figuring it out:

Developing your voice.

Finding what resonates.

Refining your skills as a writer.

Most people rush this phase. Big mistake.

Like any game, if you try to skip levels, you get overwhelmed and quit. Instead, progress one level at a time—at your own pace.

Post 1x Weekly Newsletter.

Nothing else. No Notes. No comments. No pressure.

Your only goal at this level: Build the habit.

Post 1x Weekly Newsletter.

Post 3-5 Weekly Notes.

Notes introduce you to new readers—without overwhelming your writing schedule.

Post 1x Weekly Newsletter.

At this level, you start engaging with others—because Substack is a community.

Post 1x Weekly Newsletter.

Post 1-3x Daily Notes.

Post 5-10x Daily Comments.

Casual Collaborations.

Now you’re consistently visible. You show up. People recognize your name. They begin sharing your work.

Post 1-2x Weekly Newsletter.

Post 1-3x Daily Notes.

Post 10x Daily Comments.

Generate 'Recommendations'.

Optimize Your Publication Theme.

Leverage Substack To Build Email List.

At this level, you aren’t just playing—you’re competing. Substack becomes a core component of your business.

These ‘bonuses’ can be added anytime, if and when you choose.

Most people fail on Substack for one simple reason: they burn out.

They think more is better—more posts, more Notes, more engagement. But just like starting a video game on Hardcore Mode, they get overwhelmed and quit because it’s too hard and not fun.

Here’s what burnout looks like:

Struggling to post consistently.

Feeling like you should be doing more.

Running out of ideas.

Losing motivation to write.

The secret to long-term success?

Start small, stay consistent, and only level up when it feels almost too easy.

This isn’t about “hustling” your way to growth. It’s about finding your sustainable pace.

How to Know If You’re Doing Too Much?

You feel drained instead of excited after writing.

You’re forcing yourself to post instead of looking forward to it.

You begin to dread logging into Substack.

When that happens? Dial it back.

You don’t need to do everything—you just need to do what’s sustainable.

I played on Beginner Mode for 10 months before leveling up.

Most people don’t believe me when I say that.

After releasing my first guide, I got messages from people feeling “stuck,” wondering if they should push harder—or worse, trying to start on Hardcore Mode from day one.

Here’s what I tell them:

If it still feels hard, you don’t need to level up.

If it feels too easy, now’s the time.

There’s no prize for moving faster. Progress at your own pace.

The best creators I know don’t rush. They build sustainable habits first, then scale up when they’re ready.

Before increasing difficulty, ask yourself:

Am I publishing my newsletter consistently? (Without stress or missed weeks?)

Do I have a writing rhythm that feels natural—not forced?

Am I regularly getting engagement (comments, replies, shares)?

Do I feel confident in my current posting flow?

Am I excited to add more, rather than overwhelmed by the idea?

If you answered ‘yes’ to at least 4 of these, you’re ready.

If not? Stay where you are.

There’s nothing wrong with mastering one level before moving up.

Instead of trying to “do it all,” I focused on just three core strategies:

Newsletters/Posts (Trust & Engagement)

Notes (Visibility & Discovery)

Comments (Community & Networking)

Everything else? Optional.

I pick and choose like a growth menu. Sometimes pushing, sometimes pulling back.

If you’re feeling overwhelmed, pause. There’s nothing wrong with staying at Level 1 longer than someone else.

Your only real goal? Stay in the game.

More on my “No-Hustle” Growth Strategies Here.

Your newsletter is the foundation of your Substack.

If you do nothing else—send a weekly newsletter.

It’s what people subscribe for. It builds trust. It deepens connection.

Newsletters go directly to inboxes—unlike Notes, which rely on the algorithm.

It’s where long-term readers are built.

It’s your best monetization channel down the line.

What to Focus On (Especially Early On):

Consistency over perfection—1x per week.

Clarity over complexity—write like you talk.

Engagement over performance—don’t chase virality, chase connection.

Start here: If you’re not publishing a newsletter (or ‘long-form’ posts) consistently, nothing else will move the needle. I will explain why I start with Posts over Notes shortly.

Newsletters build trust. Notes build visibility.

Think of Notes as your organic marketing channel inside Substack. They introduce you to new readers, keep you top-of-mind, and drive your growth.

Notes are discovery-focused—they help people find you.

The Substack algorithm amplifies Notes, but not newsletters.

Low effort, high impact—quick posts can get you seen.

When ready, post 3-5 Notes per week (start there, scale up).

Mix value + personality—share insights, quick thoughts, and lessons.

Keep it conversational—Notes feel like social media, not long-form.

If you want faster growth, Notes are a must. They introduce you to new readers without you having to do extra promotion.

Comments are your low-effort visibility hack.

Every comment you leave is a free visibility for your work. People notice thoughtful contributions, click your profile, and some subscribe—without you ever having to "sell" yourself.

High visibility: You’re engaging where readers already are.

Zero friction: No need to create new content—just interact.

Relationship-driven: Comments open doors to collabs, recommendations, and networking.

How to Do It Without Wasting Time:

Comment in the margins of life. Waiting at Starbucks? Drop a comment.

Bookmark 5-10 people in your niche and engage with them consistently.

Avoid “great post!”—add value. Be specific, be insightful.

If you’re too busy to write more, try commenting more. It’s one of the simplest ways to get in front of new readers after your foundation is established.

Why build an audience from scratch when you can borrow one?

Collabs—whether through guest posts, or joint lives—put you in front of a warm audience that already trusts someone else.

You tap into existing trust. Their audience now sees you as valuable.

Immediate exposure boost. No waiting for an audience to build.

It scales effortlessly. One great collab can bring thousands of views.

How to Start (Even If You’re Small):

Comment & engage first—build rapport before pitching.

Offer value. Don’t ask to “guest post”—pitch a win-win idea.

Start with peers, not A-listers. You’ll get better responses.

Ask. Sometimes that’s all it takes.

One collab can do more for growth than multiple posts. Prioritize relationship-building, and collabs will come naturally.

Imagine getting new subscribers without posting anything.

That’s the power of Substack Recommendations. When someone recommends your publication, their readers see you—and many subscribe.

Zero effort required. Once acquired, they work passively.

High-trust growth. People trust the creators they follow—if they recommend you, it’s like a warm intro.

Compounds over time. The more you get, the more they snowball.

How to Get More Recommendations:

Recommend others first. Some will return the favor.

Engage with Substacks you admire. Build genuine relationships. Ask.

Create Recommendation-worthy content.

It’s the easiest way to get new subscribers without extra work.

Your Substack should be clear, easy to navigate, and optimized for growth.

Your homepage = your business card. Make it easy for readers to explore.

Strategic links drive action. Readers should instinctively know where to go next.

Better design = more leads and sales. If your Substack is optimized, you can begin generating leads and sales every time they visit your page.

Quick Wins to Improve Your Theme:

Navigation Links: Add lead magnets, resources, or key categories to your navigation bar.

Homepage Optimization: Feature your best posts, offers, or a “Start Here” section.

Welcome Email: Set up an email that introduces you, shares your top content, and directs new subscribers to your best work.

Pinned “Start Here” Post: Use a pinned post to guide new visitors, highlight your best work, and offer a clear next step (like subscribing or buying).

CTA Integration: Naturally include links within your posts (e.g., related content, lead magnets, offers) without being spammy.

Your Substack should feel like a well-designed website. Small changes = big impact.

Think of these like bonus upgrades in a video game.

You don’t need them to succeed—but if you add them at the right time, they can supercharge your growth, engagement, and monetization.

These features aren’t required to build a thriving Substack. You can grow just fine by sticking to the core strategies. But if you’re ready to experiment, these Power-Ups can make everything easier, faster, and more fun.

Use them when it makes sense. Ignore them if it doesn’t. Your game, your pace.

Most people think Substack monetization = paid subscriptions.

That’s only one option. And for most new writers, it’s not the best first step.

You can monetize early—even with a small audience, hindering growth.

Multiple revenue streams = long-term sustainability.

Paid newsletters aren’t the only way. Many creators leverage Substack to sell products, services, and digital assets.

How to Monetize (Beyond Paid Newsletters):

Build an Email List First – Use Substack to grow your audience, then monetize via coaching, courses, or products.

Strategic Linking – Add custom links in your navigation bar, homepage, and posts to drive traffic to offers.

Leverage Recommendations – More recommendations = more subscribers = more monetization opportunities.

Use Substack Chat & Lives – These features build deeper relationships, survey your audience, and drive direct sales.

Here are 19 Ways To Monetize Your Substack—Even If You Think You Have Nothing to Sell.

Substack Lives are one of the most underrated features for engagement and visibility.

When you go live, Substack sends email notifications to your audience—bringing people in without relying on the algorithm.

Direct inbox exposure. Lives get automatic email ‘promotion’ to your subscribers.

Deepens audience connection. Face-to-face interaction builds stronger loyalty.

Collaborations = Instant New Eyeballs. Go live with another creator and double your reach.

How to Use Substack Lives Effectively:

Host a Q&A or teaching session. Give readers a reason to show up live.

Go live with another Substack writer. Their audience gets notified, too.

Promote replays and create clips. Not everyone will join live, but they’ll watch later.

If you want stronger engagement & growth—start experimenting with Lives.

Substack Chat is like having a direct text line to your subscribers.

Instead of fighting for attention on social media, you can build a tight-knit community inside Substack.

It lands directly in subscribers’ notifications.

Casual, unfiltered connection. No pressure—can be quick updates, polls, or thoughts.

Engagement without overcommitting. A fast way to keep readers engaged between newsletters.

How to Use Chat Effectively:

Ask questions & spark discussions. Get people talking.

Share behind-the-scenes content. Give them a peek into your process.

Use it to test ideas & validate topics. See what resonates before writing a full post or creating a product.

If you want a community without a Facebook Group, Substack Chat is a no-brainer.

Ever written a great post… and felt like it didn’t get the attention it deserved?

You’re not alone. Creating valuable content is only half the battle—getting it in front of the right audience is what truly fuels growth.

That’s where repurposing can come in. Instead of constantly creating from scratch, maximize what you’ve already written.

I’ve gone hardcore with repurposing before—turning every article into YouTube videos, podcasts, and 3-5 short-form clips per day. It burned me out.

But my lazy repurposing strategy? That’s been a game-changer.

My “Lazy” Repurposing Strategy:

Share long-form posts on Medium & LinkedIn. Set it and forget it—low effort, extra visibility.

Repost key takeaways as Notes. Turns one idea into multiple touchpoints.

Link all social media bios back to Substack. Simple way to capture new readers.

Only focus on where you already have an audience. If you’re big on LinkedIn, repurpose there. No need to be everywhere.

I’ve gained 1,500+ views, 100 subscribers, and $632.06 in revenue from repurposing alone—without creating anything new.

Repurposing takes time—not everyone needs to do it. But if you’re looking for low-effort growth, it could be an easy win.

Don’t let your best ideas die after one post. Get more mileage from your work.

Start with Posts, then scaffold on Notes.

Posts or ‘long-form’ content builds trust and rapport with your audience. It is what they subscribe to receive. This content is a direct line to their email inbox.

Notes or ‘short-form’ content builds awareness and increases visibility. Yes, it also builds trust and rapport, it is the content that grows our subscriber base.

Notes are controlled by an algorithm—Posts aren’t.

It’s not a question of this or that. Optimal growth requires both. Publications that publish Posts but no Notes may struggle to grow. Publications that publish Notes but not Posts may struggle to build trust and monetize.

My recommendation: Start with Posts. Then add Notes.

Start with quantity, then improve quality, repeat.

In the beginning, I believe it’s most important to build the habit. Consistently writing and consistently publishing. In my experience, quality is subjective—what one person thinks is a work of art is not to another. Focus on publishing, not perfection.

In this manner, the quantity is whatever cadence you choose. Doesn’t matter if it’s daily or weekly, the goal is building the habit. As the habit develops you shift your focus to incremental improvements in quality.

This was the approach I took and what I recommend to others.

When I started on Substack in September 2023 I published 1 long-form post per week. Saturday mornings I would sit down with a Nitro Cold Brew, plug in my binaural beats, and write and publish my post.

My writing got better through repetition. And with time I had a desire to improve. Once my routine was set I began improving my headlines and titles. Then I improved the structure of my posts. Today, my focus is the “big idea” of my posts.

Quality is a long-term journey. But it cannot be refined if we’re not putting in the repetitions and actively publishing. This is why my recommendation is: build the habit (quantity) and then refine the skill (quality).

Most people burn out because they aim too high, too soon.

Instead, shrink your habit until it’s impossible to fail.

For me? My MVH is putting my hands on the keyboard daily. Not writing 1,000 words. Not publishing every day. Just showing up.

Some days, I write 1,500 words. Other days, just 47. But I never break the streak.

Here’s how to create your own MVH:

Shrink it down. What’s the smallest possible version of your habit?

Make it feel almost too easy. You should be able to do it on your worst day.

Let consistency drive progress. Once the habit is set, leveling up is easy(er).

Sustainable growth beats sprinting and quitting. The key to winning is just staying in the game.

If you take nothing else from this guide, remember this:

Consistency beats everything.

Substack growth isn’t about chasing hacks, going viral, or working 10x harder than everyone else. It’s about showing up, staying in the game, and leveling up at your own pace.

Every strategy in this guide works.

But they only work if you stick with them long enough to see results.

If you’re overwhelmed? Go back a level.

If you feel stuck? Slow down or do less, don’t quit.

If you’re growing? Keep going—but at a pace you can sustain.

This is a long game. The people who win are the ones who don’t burn out, don’t quit, and keep building—one step at a time.

If you skimmed, here’s everything in one place.

Level 1: Weekly newsletter. Start here.

Level 2: Add 3-5 Notes per week.

Level 3: Post daily Notes + casual comments.

Level 4: Engage with 5-10 daily comments + light collaborations.

Level 5: Go all in—daily Notes, comments, collaborations, and recommendations.

Substack Lives: Instant exposure + direct engagement.

Substack Chat: A direct line to your audience.

Monetization: Beyond paid newsletters—products, services, etc.

Content Repurposing: Get more mileage from your best ideas.

Quantity → Quality: Publish consistently, then refine.

Minimal Viable Habit (MVH): Keep your habit so small it’s impossible to fail.

Consistency beats everything: The biggest advantage is staying in the game.

Final Step: Pick One & Take Action.

Don’t try to do everything at once. Pick one strategy, implement it, and build from there.

The next level is waiting.

In Subliminal Selling, I’ll give you my straightforward 3-step process to pinpoint exactly what your readers want, create a profitable digital product with zero-cost tools, and make your first sale in record time.

Go live with another Substack writer. Their audience gets notified, too.

Promote replays and create clips. Not everyone will join live, but they’ll watch later.

If you want stronger engagement & growth—start experimenting with Lives.

Substack Chat is like having a direct text line to your subscribers.

Instead of fighting for attention on social media, you can build a tight-knit community inside Substack.

It lands directly in subscribers’ notifications.

Casual, unfiltered connection. No pressure—can be quick updates, polls, or thoughts.

Engagement without overcommitting. A fast way to keep readers engaged between newsletters.

How to Use Chat Effectively:

Ask questions & spark discussions. Get people talking.

Share behind-the-scenes content. Give them a peek into your process.

Use it to test ideas & validate topics. See what resonates before writing a full post or creating a product.

If you want a community without a Facebook Group, Substack Chat is a no-brainer.

Ever written a great post… and felt like it didn’t get the attention it deserved?

You’re not alone. Creating valuable content is only half the battle—getting it in front of the right audience is what truly fuels growth.

That’s where repurposing can come in. Instead of constantly creating from scratch, maximize what you’ve already written.

I’ve gone hardcore with repurposing before—turning every article into YouTube videos, podcasts, and 3-5 short-form clips per day. It burned me out.

But my lazy repurposing strategy? That’s been a game-changer.

My “Lazy” Repurposing Strategy:

Share long-form posts on Medium & LinkedIn. Set it and forget it—low effort, extra visibility.

Repost key takeaways as Notes. Turns one idea into multiple touchpoints.

Link all social media bios back to Substack. Simple way to capture new readers.

Only focus on where you already have an audience. If you’re big on LinkedIn, repurpose there. No need to be everywhere.

I’ve gained 1,500+ views, 100 subscribers, and $632.06 in revenue from repurposing alone—without creating anything new.

Repurposing takes time—not everyone needs to do it. But if you’re looking for low-effort growth, it could be an easy win.

Don’t let your best ideas die after one post. Get more mileage from your work.

Start with Posts, then scaffold on Notes.

Posts or ‘long-form’ content builds trust and rapport with your audience. It is what they subscribe to receive. This content is a direct line to their email inbox.

Notes or ‘short-form’ content builds awareness and increases visibility. Yes, it also builds trust and rapport, it is the content that grows our subscriber base.

Notes are controlled by an algorithm—Posts aren’t.

It’s not a question of this or that. Optimal growth requires both. Publications that publish Posts but no Notes may struggle to grow. Publications that publish Notes but not Posts may struggle to build trust and monetize.

My recommendation: Start with Posts. Then add Notes.

Start with quantity, then improve quality, repeat.

In the beginning, I believe it’s most important to build the habit. Consistently writing and consistently publishing. In my experience, quality is subjective—what one person thinks is a work of art is not to another. Focus on publishing, not perfection.

In this manner, the quantity is whatever cadence you choose. Doesn’t matter if it’s daily or weekly, the goal is building the habit. As the habit develops you shift your focus to incremental improvements in quality.

This was the approach I took and what I recommend to others.

When I started on Substack in September 2023 I published 1 long-form post per week. Saturday mornings I would sit down with a Nitro Cold Brew, plug in my binaural beats, and write and publish my post.

My writing got better through repetition. And with time I had a desire to improve. Once my routine was set I began improving my headlines and titles. Then I improved the structure of my posts. Today, my focus is the “big idea” of my posts.

Quality is a long-term journey. But it cannot be refined if we’re not putting in the repetitions and actively publishing. This is why my recommendation is: build the habit (quantity) and then refine the skill (quality).

Most people burn out because they aim too high, too soon.

Instead, shrink your habit until it’s impossible to fail.

For me? My MVH is putting my hands on the keyboard daily. Not writing 1,000 words. Not publishing every day. Just showing up.

Some days, I write 1,500 words. Other days, just 47. But I never break the streak.

Here’s how to create your own MVH:

Shrink it down. What’s the smallest possible version of your habit?

Make it feel almost too easy. You should be able to do it on your worst day.

Let consistency drive progress. Once the habit is set, leveling up is easy(er).

Sustainable growth beats sprinting and quitting. The key to winning is just staying in the game.

If you take nothing else from this guide, remember this:

Consistency beats everything.

Substack growth isn’t about chasing hacks, going viral, or working 10x harder than everyone else. It’s about showing up, staying in the game, and leveling up at your own pace.

Every strategy in this guide works.

But they only work if you stick with them long enough to see results.

If you’re overwhelmed? Go back a level.

If you feel stuck? Slow down or do less, don’t quit.

If you’re growing? Keep going—but at a pace you can sustain.

This is a long game. The people who win are the ones who don’t burn out, don’t quit, and keep building—one step at a time.

If you skimmed, here’s everything in one place.

Level 1: Weekly newsletter. Start here.

Level 2: Add 3-5 Notes per week.

Level 3: Post daily Notes + casual comments.

Level 4: Engage with 5-10 daily comments + light collaborations.

Level 5: Go all in—daily Notes, comments, collaborations, and recommendations.

Substack Lives: Instant exposure + direct engagement.

Substack Chat: A direct line to your audience.

Monetization: Beyond paid newsletters—products, services, etc.

Content Repurposing: Get more mileage from your best ideas.

Quantity → Quality: Publish consistently, then refine.

Minimal Viable Habit (MVH): Keep your habit so small it’s impossible to fail.

Consistency beats everything: The biggest advantage is staying in the game.

Final Step: Pick One & Take Action.

Don’t try to do everything at once. Pick one strategy, implement it, and build from there.
