## DEEDYDAS PATTERNS (212K followers - Tech/VC)

### Single Tweet Style

**Pattern 1: Quote + Commentary**
```
A kid applying to college told me:

"you have to be an idiot to say you're Asian with a 'startup' applying for engineering or CS. Everyone makes up a lie about how they're into Latin / African American studies and plays squash / lacrosse.

Narrative is everything."
```

- Setup line

- Punch line conclusion

**Engagement**: 39 replies, 14 reposts, 678 likes

**Pattern 2: Data-Driven Analysis + Image**
```
Here's every single product OpenAI is working on.

It makes a lot of sense. Reminds me of early Facebook / Google. When you have distribution (~1B users), just build everything and see what sticks.

And who better to run that playbook than the ex-boss of Y Combinator! [+ chart image]

There's never been a better time in technology to be building.

## LONG-FORM POST STRUCTURE (Based on Research)

### Hook (First 280 Characters - CRITICAL)

**This appears in feed. Must compel "Show more" click.**

**Effective hook structures**:

```
STRUCTURE 1: Problem + Promise
{Attention-grabbing problem}

{Brief context}

Here's what most people miss: [Show more]
```

```
STRUCTURE 2: Bold Claim + Intrigue
I {accomplished X} in {timeframe}.

The playbook: [Show more]
```

```
STRUCTURE 3: Data + Insight Tease
{Surprising statistic}

After analyzing {number} {items}, I found a pattern.

Here's what it means: [Show more]
```

### Body (After "Show more")

**Structure**:
```
[Continue from hook]

## Section 1 (if using headings)
{Detailed explanation}

{Supporting evidence}

## Section 2
{Next point}

{Examples}

## Section 3
{Application}

{Actionable insights}

[Conclusion]

{CTA or question}
```

**Best Practices**:
- Use line breaks liberally
- Bold for **emphasis**
- Numbered lists when applicable
- Images/visuals throughout
- Conversational tone (even in long-form)
- 500-2500 characters typical
- Keep sections short (2-4 paragraphs each)
