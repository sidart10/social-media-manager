- [Create a Webhook](https://docs.exa.ai/websets/api/webhooks/create-a-webhook.md): Webhooks let you get notifications when things happen in your Websets. When you create a webhook, you choose which events you want to know about and where to send the notifications.

When an event happens, Exa sends an HTTP POST request to your webhook URL with:
- Event details (type, time, ID)
- Full data of what triggered the event
- A signature to verify the request came from Exa

The webhook starts as `active` and begins getting notifications right away. You'll get a secret key for checking webhook signatures - save this safely as it's only shown once when you create the webhook.
- [Delete a Webhook](https://docs.exa.ai/websets/api/webhooks/delete-a-webhook.md): Remove a webhook from your account. Once deleted, the webhook stops getting notifications right away and cannot be brought back.

Important notes: - The webhook stops working as soon as you delete it - You cannot undo this - you'll need to create a new webhook if you want it back - Any notifications currently being sent may still complete
- [Get a Webhook](https://docs.exa.ai/websets/api/webhooks/get-a-webhook.md): Get information about a webhook using its ID.
The webhook secret is not shown here for security - you only get it when you first create the webhook.
- [List webhooks](https://docs.exa.ai/websets/api/webhooks/list-webhooks.md): Get a list of all webhooks in your account.
The results come in pages. Use `limit` to set how many webhooks to get per page (up to 200). Use `cursor` to get the next page of results.
- [Update a Webhook](https://docs.exa.ai/websets/api/webhooks/update-a-webhook.md): Change a webhook's settings. You can update:
- Events: Add or remove which events you want to hear about - URL: Change where notifications are sent - Metadata: Update custom data linked to the webhook

Changes happen right away. If you change the events list, the webhook will start or stop getting notifications for those events immediately.

The webhook keeps its current status (`active` or `inactive`) when you update it.
