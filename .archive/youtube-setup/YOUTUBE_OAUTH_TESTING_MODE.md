# YouTube OAuth - Enable Testing Mode

## You're on the right page, but need to configure the app!

### 🔍 Check Publishing Status

Look at the top of the OAuth consent screen page. You should see:

**Publishing status:** Testing / In production / Not published

---

## 📋 If App is NOT Configured Yet:

### Click "EDIT APP" Button

1. Look for **"EDIT APP"** button (usually top right)
2. Click it to configure your OAuth consent screen

### Or Navigate Through the Setup:

In the left sidebar, you might see steps like:

- OAuth consent screen
- Scopes
- Test users ← This is where you add yourself!

Click through each section to configure.

## 🎯 Quick Alternative: Publish the App

**Easier solution if you don't see Test users section:**

### Make the App Public (Simpler for Personal Use)

1. Look for **"PUBLISH APP"** button
2. Click it
3. Confirm
4. Your app becomes available to anyone (including you!)

**Note:** Since this is YOUR app for YOUR YouTube channel, publishing it is fine. You're the only one who will use it.

## 🚀 Fastest Solution:

**Use the old Desktop app instead!**

I noticed you have TWO OAuth clients:

- **social-media-manager-v2** (Web application) - Having issues
- **social media manager** (Desktop) - Might work better!

### Try the Desktop App:

The Desktop app (349586011941-p46d...) doesn't need test users or redirect URIs!

Let me update the config to use that one instead.

## Which would you prefer?

**A)** Configure Web app (add test users or publish)
**B)** Switch back to Desktop app (simpler, no test users needed)
**C)** Just publish the Web app (makes it public, but that's fine)

**Recommendation:** Option C (Publish) is fastest! It's YOUR app for YOUR channel.
