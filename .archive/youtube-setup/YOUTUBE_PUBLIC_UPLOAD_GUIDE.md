# YouTube API - Public Upload Guide

**Issue:** Videos uploaded via API are locked to "Private" by default
**Reason:** Unverified app (Google policy since July 28, 2020)
**Solution:** Get app verified OR manually publish each video

---

## üö® Why Videos Are Private

**Google Policy (Since July 2020):**

All API projects created after July 28, 2020 have uploads locked to **private** until the app passes YouTube's compliance audit.

**This affects:**

- ‚úÖ You can upload videos
- ‚ùå Videos locked to "Private" automatically
- ‚ùå Cannot set to "Public" or "Unlisted" via API
- ‚úÖ You CAN manually change to public in YouTube Studio

**Why Google does this:**

- Prevent spam/abuse via automated uploads
- Ensure apps follow Terms of Service
- Protect users and platform
