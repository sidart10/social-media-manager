SIMPLEST FIX FOR YOUTUBE OAUTH
================================

You have a Desktop OAuth app that's easier to use!

OPTION 1: PUBLISH THE WEB APP (30 seconds)
-------------------------------------------
1. On the OAuth consent screen page
2. Look for "PUBLISH APP" button (top right or in settings)
3. Click it
4. Confirm
5. Done! No test users needed.

OPTION 2: USE DESKTOP APP INSTEAD (I can switch it)
---------------------------------------------------
Just say "use desktop app for YouTube" and I'll update the config
to use your other OAuth client (Desktop type).

Desktop apps don't need:
- Redirect URIs
- Test users
- Publishing

They just work!

QUICKEST: Option 1 (Publish) - Click one button and you're done!
