## NOTION IMPORT PREPARATION

### Option A: Jarvis Creates Directly via MCP

I can create all 68 entries in your Notion database right now using the Notion MCP server.

**Advantages:**
- Instant population
- All fields filled correctly
- Relationships connected (Channels, etc.)

**Disadvantages:**
- Need Notion MCP configured first
- Harder to bulk-edit before creation

### Option B: CSV Template for Bulk Import

I can generate a CSV file you import into Notion.

**Advantages:**
- Can review all ideas in spreadsheet first
- Easier bulk editing before import
- No MCP setup required yet

**Disadvantages:**
- Notion CSV import sometimes drops fields
- Relations (Channels) may need manual linking

### Option C: Markdown Checklist (Manual Entry)

I can create a formatted list you copy into Notion one by one.

**Advantages:**
- Full control over each entry
- Can adjust as you go
- No technical setup

**Disadvantages:**
- Time-intensive (68 entries)
- Error-prone (manual data entry)

---

## RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS

**IMMEDIATE (Next 30 minutes):**

1. **Review the 68 content ideas** (this document)
   - Do these make sense?
   - Any you want to remove/adjust?
   - Any gaps in topics?

2. **Choose Notion population method:**
   - MCP direct creation (I do it now)
   - CSV template (I generate, you import)
   - Manual (I provide formatted list)

3. **Confirm start date:**
   - Start posting tomorrow (Oct 31)?
   - Or push to Nov 1 or Nov 4?

**THEN (Setup phase):**

4. **If MCP chosen:** Set up Notion integration (15 min, I'll guide)
5. **Populate Notion** with all 68 entries
6. **Add custom fields** (Post Type, Voice Mode, etc.)
7. **Test workflow** with 1 piece (validate end-to-end)

**FINALLY (Execution):**

8. **Tomorrow morning:** Generate first 2 pieces (thread + LinkedIn)
9. **Review in Notion** → Edit → Publish
10. **Track what works** → Adjust in real-time

---

**The ideas are generated. The workflow is designed. The Notion structure is mapped.**

**What's your call:**
1. **Notion population method?** (MCP, CSV, or Manual)
2. **Start date?** (Oct 31, Nov 1, or Nov 4)
3. **Any content ideas to adjust** before we populate?
