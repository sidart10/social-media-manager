## SPECIAL NOTES FOR WEEK 1 (Nov 4-10)

### These Entries Need Research First (Nov 3):

All Week 1 entries (Nov 4-10) are set to Status = "Idea" because they depend on the agent platform research you'll do on Sunday Nov 3.

**After Nov 3 research:**
- Entries change from "Idea" → "Next Up" (ready to generate)
- Content gets written referencing the Substack hub
- All pieces atomized from one research session

### Entries Requiring Sub-Agents:

**Nov 4 LinkedIn** - Needs 5-slide carousel (AI Image Generator)
**Nov 5 Video** - Needs 60s video production (AI Video Agent)
**Nov 6 LinkedIn** - Needs 6-slide carousel (AI Image Generator)
**Nov 7 Video** - Needs 60s video production (AI Video Agent)
**Nov 9 Video** - Needs 60s video production (AI Video Agent)

**Process:**
1. I generate script/post text
2. I create handoff package for sub-agent
3. You trigger sub-agent: `/ai-video-agent` or `/ai-image-generator`
4. They produce assets
5. Social Posting Agent publishes with media
