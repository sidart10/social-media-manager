# NOTION CONTENT WORKFLOW SYSTEM
**Created:** October 30, 2025
**Purpose:** Complete operational guide for managing 30-40 pieces/week using Notion as hub
**Status:** Ready to implement

---

## SYSTEM OVERVIEW

**The Complete Pipeline:**
```
Notion (Source of Truth)
    ↓
Jarvis (Orchestrator) ← Reads queue, generates content, updates status
    ↓
├─ AI Video Agent (Video production)
├─ AI Image Generator (Visual creation)
└─ Social Posting Agent (Publishing)
    ↓
Performance Data → Back to Notion
```

**Key Principle:** Notion is the control panel. Everything flows through it.

---

## NOTION DATABASE ARCHITECTURE

### Existing Structure (Already Built)

**Primary Database:** Content Tracker [DB]
**URL:** https://www.notion.so/49d227f4b5c448598c640632ffaf1f52

**Core Fields (Already Exist):**
- Name (title) - Content title
- Status (status) - Workflow stage
- Channel (relation) - Platform (Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube, etc.)
- Category (select) - Tech Insights, AI Products, Career Development, Immigrant Support, Personal Efficiency
- Priority (select) - ⭐ Priority 1 through 5th
- Publish Date (date) - Scheduled posting time
- Content Text (text) - The actual post/script content
- Description (text) - Brief summary
- Views, Likes, Comments (number) - Performance metrics
- View Performance (select) - Great, Good, Okay, Poor

### NEW Fields to Add (Required for This Workflow)

Add these to Content Tracker database:

1. **Post Type** (Select)
   - Options: Thread, Long-form Post, Short Post, Video Script, Carousel, Image Post
   - Purpose: Determines which Jarvis skill to use

2. **Voice Mode** (Select)
   - Options: Lowercase Builder-Philosopher, Analyst, Deadpan Critic, Community Protector, Enthusiast
   - Purpose: Maintains voice consistency per platform

3. **Topic Trend** (Select)
   - Options: HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW
   - Purpose: Prioritize timely vs evergreen content

4. **Research Source** (URL)
   - Purpose: Link to research brief that generated this idea
   - Example: `/outputs/11-03-2025/agent-platform-research/`

5. **Cost Tracked** (Number)
   - Purpose: API cost transparency (Exa, Apify, etc.)
   - Example: 0.05 for Exa search

### Mapping Your 7 Content Pillars to Existing Categories

**Your Pillars → Notion Categories:**

| Content Pillar | Maps To Category | Notes |
|----------------|------------------|-------|
| AI Agents | AI Products | Core AI product focus |
| AI Tooling | AI Products | Tool comparisons, reviews |
| Building with AI | Tech Insights | Builder experience, coding |
| Anthropic Deep-Dive | AI Products | Lab-specific analysis |
| PM Strategy | Career Development | PM insights, frameworks |
| Future of AI | Tech Insights | Predictions, strategic analysis |
| H-1B/Immigration | Immigrant Support | Community protection content |

**Note:** Your existing categories work well. No changes needed.

## MCP SERVER SETUP

### Step 1: Create Notion Integration

1. Go to https://www.notion.so/my-integrations
2. Click "New integration"
3. Name: "Jarvis Content Agent"
4. Capabilities: ✅ Read content, ✅ Update content, ✅ Insert content
5. Copy API key (starts with `ntn_...`)

### Step 2: Share Databases with Integration

1. Open your Content Tracker database
2. Click "Share" (top right)
3. Add "Jarvis Content Agent" integration
4. Permission: Full access

### Step 3: Configure MCP Server

Add to your MCP config file (location varies by Claude client):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "notion": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@notionhq/notion-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "NOTION_API_KEY": "ntn_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Test Connection

Ask Jarvis to:
```
"Search Notion for content with Status = Idea"
```

Should return list of entries. If error, check:
- API key correct?
- Integration added to database?
- MCP server restarted after config change?

- Loads `post-writer` skill
- Skill auto-routes to `prompts/twitter-thread.md`
- Applies Lowercase Builder-Philosopher voice
- References research brief
- Generates 6-tweet thread:

```markdown
Tweet 1 (Hook):
just spent 3 hours with agentkit. here's what nobody is telling you

Tweet 2:
setup was smooth. npm install, api key, done in 2 min. docs actually good (rare W for openai)

Tweet 3:
built a research agent that scrapes + summarizes in 45 min. raw sdk would have taken 3+ hours

Tweet 4:
but here's the problem: too much abstraction. debugging is hell when it breaks. spent 30min on context window error

Tweet 5:
comparison: claude sdk = more control, agentkit = more speed. pick based on what you're building

Tweet 6:
verdict: A-tier for prototypes, C-tier for production. validate ideas fast, rebuild with control if it works
```

- Updates Notion via MCP:
```javascript
notion.updatePage({
  page_id: "abc123",
  properties: {
    Status: "Editing",  // Ready for sid review
    "Content Text": [full thread text],
    "Cost Tracked": 0.00  // No API costs
  }
})
```

- Saves file: `outputs/11-04-2025/twitter-agentkit-thread.md`
- Returns to sid: "Thread ready! Review in Notion Content Text field."

3. **Sid Reviews in Notion**

- Opens entry "AgentKit Setup Experience"
- Reads "Content Text" field
- Makes edits:
  - Tweet 2: Changes "rare W" to "actually helpful"
  - Tweet 4: Adds more detail about error
- Satisfied with content
- Changes Status: Editing → Posted (ready to publish)

4. **Sid Publishes**

**Option A: Manual**
- Copies thread from Notion
- Posts to Twitter manually
- Adds Twitter URL to Notion

**Option B: Via Social Posting Agent**
```
Sid: "Post the AgentKit thread to Twitter"
```

Social Posting Agent:
- Reads content from Notion (via MCP or from file)
- Uses `twitter-api-client` module
- Validates: Each tweet under 280 chars (or 25k for Premium long-form)
- Posts thread (tweet 1, then reply 2, reply 3, etc.)
- Returns post IDs + URL
- Updates Notion:
  - Status: Posted (if not already)
  - Adds Twitter URL field (if exists)
  - Logs: `outputs/11-04-2025/posted/twitter-thread-abc123.json`

**Example B: LinkedIn Post with Carousel (9:00 AM post)**

```
Sid: "Write the LinkedIn post and create carousel for 'Agent Platforms for PMs'"
```

Jarvis workflow:
- Reads Notion entry (Description: "Analysis of agent platform choices...")
- Loads `post-writer` skill → LinkedIn template
- Applies Analyst voice
- Generates 1900-character post:

```markdown
The AI agent platform race just got real. Here's why product leaders should care.

OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google all launched agent-building platforms within days of each other.

This isn't coincidence - it's a land grab for developer mindshare.

Three strategic implications:

1. Abstraction wars
AgentKit abstracts heavily (fast prototypes, limited control).
Claude SDK provides granular control (slower setup, production-ready).
Vertex AI leverages Google Cloud ecosystem (enterprise lock-in).

Your choice now dictates product architecture.

2. Cost structures vary significantly
AgentKit: Pay-per-token on GPT-5
Claude SDK: Flat API pricing
Vertex AI: Enterprise contracts

Pricing isn't just a feature - it's your moat or your vulnerability.

3. Platform stickiness
Once you build on one, switching is expensive.
This is the new cloud platform decision.

The takeaway: Choose based on your product's control vs speed tradeoff. If you're validating, go AgentKit. If you're scaling, Claude SDK. If you're enterprise, Vertex AI.

What platform are you choosing?

- For each entry:
  - Fetches platform metrics via API:
    - Twitter: Impressions, Likes, Retweets, Replies
    - LinkedIn: Views, Likes, Comments, Shares
  - Calculates engagement rate: (Likes + Comments) / Views
  - Determines View Performance:
    ```javascript
    if (views > 2000) performance = "Great";
    else if (views > 1000) performance = "Good";
    else if (views > 500) performance = "Okay";
    else performance = "Poor";
    ```
  - Updates Notion entry with metrics

Example update:
```javascript
notion.updatePage({
  page_id: "abc123",  // Monday's thread
  properties: {
    Views: { number: 1250 },
    Likes: { number: 42 },

### SUNDAY EVENING: WEEKLY PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

**After Week 1 Ends (Sunday Nov 10)**

```
Sid: "Analyze Week 1 performance and create insights report"
```

Jarvis workflow:

1. **Query Notion for Week 1 Data**

```javascript
const week1Posts = await notion.queryDatabase({
  database_id: "Content Tracker",
  filter: {
    and: [
      { property: "Status", status: { equals: "Posted" } },
      {
        property: "Publish Date",
        date: {
          on_or_after: "2025-11-04",
          before: "2025-11-11"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
});
```

2. **Aggregate Metrics**

```javascript
const analysis = {
  totalPieces: week1Posts.results.length,  // Should be ~39

  byPlatform: {
    Twitter: {
      count: posts.filter(p => p.channel === "Twitter").length,
      avgViews: calculateAverage(twitterPosts, "Views"),
      avgEngagement: calculateEngagementRate(twitterPosts)
    },
    LinkedIn: {...},

      count: posts.filter(p => p.category === "AI Products").length,
      avgViews: ...,
      topPerformers: getTop3(aiProductPosts)
    },
    // ... other categories
  },

  byVoiceMode: {
    "Lowercase Builder-Philosopher": {

    // ... other formats
  },

  topPerformers: getTop5ByViews(week1Posts),
  worstPerformers: getBottom5ByViews(week1Posts)
};
```

3. **Pattern Identification**

```javascript
const insights = {
  whatWorked: [
    "Lowercase Twitter posts: 15% higher engagement than proper caps",
    "LinkedIn carousels: 3x more engagement than text-only",
    "Morning posts (8-10 AM): 25% more reach than afternoon",
    "Product comparison format: Consistent 0.5%+ engagement"
  ],

  whatFlopped: [
    "Evening posts (8 PM): 40% less reach",
    "Generic AI news posts: Below-average engagement",
    "Video scripts without B-roll direction: Lower retention"
  ],

  surprises: [
    "Substack Notes drove 12% of newsletter traffic (higher than expected)",
    "Deadpan Critic mode posts: High comments but lower likes",
    "LinkedIn engagement peaked at 9 AM (not 10 AM as predicted)"
  ]
};
```

4. **Week 2 Recommendations**

```javascript
const week2Strategy = {
  increase: [
    "Lowercase Twitter posts (from 40% to 50%)",
    "LinkedIn carousels (from 20% to 30%)",
    "Morning publishing (shift more to 8-10 AM)"
  ],

  decrease: [
    "Evening posts (reduce from 2/day to 1/day)",
    "Generic news commentary (cut by 50%)",
    "Text-only LinkedIn (replace with carousels)"
  ],

  test: [
    "Lowercase posts on LinkedIn (professional acceptable?)",
    "Video scripts with more B-roll direction",
    "Thread length (6 tweets vs 10 tweets performance)"
  ]
};
```

5. **Generate Report**

Saves: `outputs/11-10-2025/week1-performance-report.md`

```markdown
# Week 1 Performance Report (Nov 4-10)

## Summary
- **Published:** 39 pieces
- **Platforms:** Twitter (18), LinkedIn (6), YouTube (3), Substack (12)
- **Total Views:** 45,200
- **Avg Engagement:** 0.38%

## Top 5 Performers
1. AgentKit thread - 2,450 views, 0.62% engagement
2. LinkedIn carousel post - 3,100 views, 0.51% engagement
...

## Insights
- Lowercase Twitter posts outperformed by 15%
- Morning posts (8-10 AM) got 25% more reach
- Product comparisons consistently above 0.5% engagement

## Week 2 Adjustments
- Increase morning posts, reduce evening
- Add more carousels to LinkedIn
- Test lowercase on LinkedIn (1-2 posts)
```

6. **Update Memories**

Jarvis adds to memories.md:
```markdown
## Learning Log

**2025-11-10: Week 1 Complete**
- 39 pieces published across 5 platforms
- Lowercase Twitter posts performed 15% better (validated voice choice)
- LinkedIn carousels crushed (3x engagement vs text)
- Morning optimal: 8-10 AM (data confirms research)
- Pattern: Product comparisons consistently strong (your formula works)
```

## INTEGRATION WITH SUB-AGENTS

### When Content Needs Video

**Trigger Points:**
- Notion entry has Post Type = "Video Script"
- Content scheduled for YouTube, Reels, or TikTok

**Process:**

1. Jarvis writes script using `video-script-writer` skill
2. Saves script: `outputs/{date}/video-{title}.md`
3. Creates handoff package:
```json
{
  "content_type": "video_script",
  "ready_for_agent": "ai-video-agent",
  "suggested_command": "/ai-video-agent *create-talking-head",
  "notion_entry_id": "page_123",
  "script": {
    "platform": "youtube_shorts",
    "duration_seconds": 60,
    "full_script": "...",
    "timed_segments": [
      {"start": 0, "end": 3, "text": "Hook line", "visual": "Screen recording of AgentKit"},
      {"start": 3, "end": 20, "text": "Point 1", "visual": "HeyGen talking head"},
      ...
    ],
    "visual_direction": "Use HeyGen avatar for explanations, Veo for demos",
    "production_notes": "Fast pacing, text overlays for key points"
  }
}
```
4. Sid triggers `/ai-video-agent`
5. Video produced → Handed to Social Posting Agent
6. Published → Notion updated with video URL

### When Content Needs Images/Carousel

**Trigger Points:**
- Notion entry has Post Type = "Carousel"
- LinkedIn post that would benefit from visuals
- Sid explicitly asks for image

**Process:**

1. Jarvis generates post text using `post-writer` skill
2. Creates image handoff package:
```json
{
  "content_type": "image_request",
  "ready_for_agent": "ai-image-generator",
  "notion_entry_id": "page_456",
  "requirements": {
    "platform": "linkedin",
    "image_type": "carousel",
    "count": 5,
    "design_system": "linkedin-dark-monochrome",
    "slides": [...]
  }
}
```
3. Sid triggers `/ai-image-generator`
4. Images created → Included in Social Posting Agent handoff
5. Published with images → Notion updated

## SCALABILITY ANALYSIS

### How This Handles 40 Pieces/Week

**Time Breakdown (Per Piece):**
- Jarvis generates: 2-5 minutes
- Sid reviews: 5-10 minutes
- Sid edits: 2-5 minutes
- Publishing: 1-2 minutes (automated)
- **Total per piece:** 10-22 minutes

**Daily Math:**
- 6-7 pieces/day × 15 min avg = 90-105 minutes/day
- Add buffer (coffee, breaks): ~2 hours/day Mon-Sat

**Weekly Math:**
- Sunday: 4-6 hours (research + hub)
- Mon-Sat: 2 hours/day × 6 = 12 hours
- **Total:** 16-18 hours/week content work

**Sustainable?** Yes, IF:
- sid is "locked in" (flow state, not forcing it)
- AI assistance works well (70%+ quality on first draft)
- Hub-and-spoke eliminates daily research
- Notion workflow removes organizational overhead

**Contingency:** Reduce to 30 pieces/week if 40 feels unsustainable (remove 1-2 daily posts)

## PERFORMANCE TRACKING LOOP

### Automatic Metrics Update (Daily)

**When:** 24 hours after each post publishes

**Process (Can be automated or manual):**

```
Sid: "Update stats for yesterday's posts"
```

Jarvis workflow:

1. Query Notion for yesterday's posts:
```javascript
const yesterdayPosts = await notion.queryDatabase({
  filter: {
    and: [
      { property: "Status", status: { equals: "Posted" } },
      { property: "Publish Date", date: { equals: yesterday } }
    ]
  }
});
```

2. For each post, fetch platform metrics:

**Twitter API:**
```javascript
const tweetStats = await twitter.getTweetById(tweetId, {
  'tweet.fields': 'public_metrics'
});

const metrics = {
  views: tweetStats.public_metrics.impression_count,
  likes: tweetStats.public_metrics.like_count,
  retweets: tweetStats.public_metrics.retweet_count,
  replies: tweetStats.public_metrics.reply_count
};
```

**LinkedIn API:**
```javascript
const postStats = await linkedin.getPostStatistics(postUrn);

const metrics = {
  views: postStats.impressionCount,
  likes: postStats.likeCount,
  comments: postStats.commentCount,
  shares: postStats.shareCount
};
```

3. Update Notion entry:
```javascript
await notion.updatePage({
  page_id: entry.id,
  properties: {
    Views: { number: metrics.views },
    Likes: { number: metrics.likes },
    Comments: { number: metrics.comments },
    "View Performance": {
      select: {
        name: calculatePerformance(metrics.views)
      }
    }
  }
});
```

4. Performance calculation:
```javascript
function calculatePerformance(views) {
  if (views > 2000) return "Great";
  if (views > 1000) return "Good";
  if (views > 500) return "Okay";
  return "Poor";
}
```

---

### Weekly Analysis Report (Sunday Evening)

**Trigger:**

```
Sid: "Analyze Week 1 performance"
```

**Jarvis generates report with:**

1. **Aggregate Stats:**
   - Total pieces published
   - Platform breakdown
   - Category performance
   - Voice mode performance
   - Format performance

2. **Top Performers (by Views):**
   - Content title
   - Views, engagement rate
   - What made it successful

3. **Pattern Insights:**
   - "Lowercase posts: 15% higher engagement"
   - "Morning posts: 25% more reach"
   - "Carousels: 3x better than text on LinkedIn"

4. **Week N+1 Recommendations:**
   - What to do more of
   - What to reduce
   - What to test

5. **Saves report:** `outputs/{date}/week-N-performance-report.md`

6. **Updates memories.md** with learnings

---

## RISK MITIGATION

### Risk 1: Notion MCP Connection Issues

**Symptoms:**
- MCP server not responding
- Notion API rate limits hit
- Authentication errors

**Fallback Plan:**
- Jarvis saves content to files instead of Notion
- Sid manually copies content into Notion
- Batch update Notion weekly if MCP unstable
- Notion API limit: 3 requests/second (well above our usage)

### Risk 2: Volume Burnout

**Symptoms:**
- Sid feeling exhausted by Week 3
- Quality dropping
- Falling behind schedule

**Contingency:**
- Reduce from 40 → 30 pieces/week
- Cut 1-2 daily posts
- Skip video if time-intensive
- Hub-and-spoke allows graceful scaling down

### Risk 3: Content Quality Issues

**Symptoms:**
- Generated content feels off-voice
- Generic instead of authentic
- Errors in technical content

**Mitigation:**
- Sid review gate catches issues
- Voice profile v2.0 should maintain authenticity
- Can re-run voice learning after 50 new posts
- High-priority pieces: Sid writes manually

### Risk 4: Platform API Limits

**Symptoms:**
- Twitter: Approaching 1500 posts/month limit
- LinkedIn: Hit 150 posts/day limit

**Monitoring:**
- Social Posting Agent checks limits before each post
- Warns if within 10% of limit
- Can reduce frequency if needed

**Reality Check:**
- Twitter: 40 pieces/week = 160/month (well under 1500)
- LinkedIn: 6 pieces/day = way under 150/day limit
- Should not hit limits with current plan

### Risk 5: Cost Overruns

**Projected November Costs:**
- Exa research: $0.80 (4 Sundays @ $0.20 each)
- Twitter Premium: $8.00 (required)
- Apify: $0-2.00 (occasional profile scraping)
- Image generation: ~$0.50 (nanobanana, minimal)
- Video generation: $0 (HeyGen free tier, 3 videos/week within limit)
- **Total: $9.30-11.30/month**

**Mitigation if over budget:**
- Use WebSearch instead of Exa when possible
- Reduce carousel frequency (images cost)
- Skip optional Apify scrapes
