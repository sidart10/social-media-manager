## THREAD CONTENT

**Tweet 1 (Hook):**
openai's agentkit launched 3 weeks ago. developers are building autonomous agents in 8 minutes that used to take months. here's what's real.

**Tweet 2 (What It Actually Is):**
agentkit isn't a chatbot builder. it's a toolkit for multi-step autonomous agents.

4 parts:
• Agent Builder (visual drag-drop workflow)
• ChatKit (embed chat in your app)
• Evals (test agent performance)
• Connector Registry (tool integrations)

**Tweet 3 (Real Build Example):**
christina huang (openai engineer) built a working agent live onstage in 8 minutes.

not a demo. actual agent: calendar integration, preference handling, booked travel autonomously.

drag-drop nodes. connect tools. deploy.

**Tweet 4 (Enterprise Results - Verified):**
real company data from DevDay:
• Ramp: dev time from 2 quarters → 2 sprints
• Carlyle: 50% faster dev, 30% better accuracy
• LY Corporation: multi-agent workflow in under 2 hours

these are shipped production agents.

**Tweet 5 (The Critical Take):**
but @Consciogen called it out:

"You're renting, not building. OpenAI controls: runtime, models, connectors."

centralized = fast iteration but platform lock-in.

switching later = rebuild everything.

**Tweet 6 (Your Take):**
agentkit is A-tier for validation. build in hours, prove concept works, get stakeholder buy-in.

but for production at scale? that lock-in risk is real.

the agent platform wars: speed vs control. pick based on your risk tolerance.
