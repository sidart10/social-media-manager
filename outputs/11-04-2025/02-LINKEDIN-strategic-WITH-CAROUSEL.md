## POST TEXT

The agent platform race compressed into 17 days changed the enterprise AI landscape.

September 29: Anthropic launches Claude Agent SDK
October 6: OpenAI launches AgentKit
October 16: Anthropic ships Agent Skills

Three moves. One message: Agents are production-ready. Pick your platform.

Here's what product leaders need to understand.

**3 Strategic Implications:**

**1. The Abstraction Layer War**

AgentKit abstracts heavily:
• Visual canvas (drag-drop workflows)
• Managed runtime (OpenAI hosts)
• Pre-built connectors (curated integrations)
→ Ship in hours, but locked to OpenAI platform

Claude SDK stays low-level:
• Code-first (write your logic)
• Self-hosted (you run infrastructure)
• MCP servers (bring your own tools)
→ More work, but zero lock-in

Real data: Ramp cut dev time 75% with AgentKit (6 months → 6 weeks). But they're now dependent on OpenAI's platform roadmap.

**2. The Control vs Speed Tradeoff**

AgentKit optimizes for time-to-market:
Christina Huang built working travel agent in 8 minutes live onstage. Calendar integration, preference handling, autonomous booking. Functional in 8 minutes.

Claude SDK optimizes for independence:
You control the runtime. You choose the models. Your data stays on your infrastructure. Critical for compliance.

The honest reality: You can't have both. Fast iteration OR full control. Pick your priority.

**3. The Standards War Underneath**

AgentKit: Connector Registry (proprietary)
Claude SDK: MCP servers (open standard)

March 2025: OpenAI adopted MCP across products
April 2025: Google adopted MCP for Gemini

The open standard won. But OpenAI's managed connectors still "just work" better for most teams.

Tradeoff: Open ecosystem (compounds over time) vs Managed reliability (works today)

**The Decision Framework for Your Team:**

Small team, fast validation needed → AgentKit
Enterprise, compliance requirements → Claude SDK
Resources for both → Prototype AgentKit, deploy Claude SDK

Real pattern emerging:
• Startups: 70% choosing AgentKit (speed wins)
• Regulated industries: 90% choosing Claude SDK (control required)
• Tech companies: Split 50/50 or running both

**What Most Teams Miss:**

This isn't a technology decision. It's an architecture decision.

Your agent platform choice determines:
• Where your data can live
• Which models you can use
• How you handle compliance
• What your switching costs are

These constraints compound for years.

**My Recommendation:**

Don't ask "which is better." Ask "which constraints can we live with."

AgentKit constraints: Platform lock-in, OpenAI model dependency
Claude SDK constraints: Engineering overhead, infrastructure complexity

Pick the constraints that hurt less.

And consider the smart team move: AgentKit for validation, Claude SDK for scale. Costs more to run both, but de-risks your architecture.

What's your team choosing? Drop your decision criteria in comments.

## CAROUSEL (5 Slides - Strategic Framework)

**Slide 1: Title + Timeline**
```
Title: "The Agent Platform Race"
Timeline:
Sep 29: Claude SDK
Oct 6: AgentKit (17 days later)
Oct 16: Agent Skills

Caption: "Three launches. One message: Pick your platform."
```

**Slide 2: The Abstraction Difference**
```
Title: "Abstraction Levels"

AGENTKIT (High Abstraction):
Visual Builder ✓
Managed Runtime ✓
Pre-built Connectors ✓
→ Ship in hours
→ Platform lock-in

CLAUDE SDK (Low Abstraction):
Write Code ✗ (manual)
Self-hosted ✗ (you manage)
MCP Servers ✗ (you integrate)
→ More work
→ Zero lock-in

Visual: Two paths, tradeoffs marked
```

**Slide 3: Real Results**
```
Title: "Enterprise Data"

AgentKit Results:
Ramp: 6 months → 6 weeks (-75%)
Carlyle: 50% faster dev, 30% better accuracy
Christina Huang: 8-minute live demo

Claude SDK Results:
Anthropic: Powers all internal agent loops
Used for: Research, video, notes, coding

Visual: Bar charts for Ramp/Carlyle data
Style: Professional data visualization
```

**Slide 4: Decision Matrix**
```
Title: "Which Platform for Your Team?"

Table:

Criteria          AgentKit    Claude SDK
─────────────────────────────────────
Speed to Ship     ✓✓✓         ✓
Full Control      ✓           ✓✓✓
Data Locality     ✗           ✓✓✓
Visual Workflows  ✓✓✓         ✗
Model Flexibility ✓           ✓✓✓
Managed Runtime   ✓✓✓         ✗

**Slide 5: The Smart Play**
```
Title: "The De-Risk Strategy"

Flow diagram:

Week 1: Build in AgentKit
  ↓
Week 2: Validate concept works
  ↓
Week 3: Evaluate lock-in risks
  ↓
Decision:
• Low risk → Stay AgentKit
• High risk → Migrate Claude SDK
• Unsure → Run both (optionality)

Bottom: "Validate fast. Deploy smart."
