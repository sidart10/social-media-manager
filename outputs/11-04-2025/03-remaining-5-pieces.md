# Monday Nov 4 - Remaining 5 Pieces (ACCURATE)

## 3. Twitter Long-Form (2:15 PM)

the agent platform lock-in problem nobody's talking about.

agentkit (openai):
you build on their visual canvas. use their connectors. run on their infrastructure.

fast to ship. christina huang built working agent in 8 minutes live.

but @Consciogen nailed it: "you're renting, not building."

switching later? rebuild from scratch. your workflows are tied to their platform.

claude SDK (anthropic):
you write code. run on your servers. bring your own MCP tool integrations.

more work upfront. but zero lock-in. swap models (gpt, claude, gemini) without changing your agent architecture.

the difference: agentkit bets on openai winning long-term. claude SDK hedges.

i'd use agentkit for rapid validation. prove the agent works in days.

then decide: stay (if openai platform works) or migrate to claude SDK (if you need independence).

this is the new cloud platform decision. choose wisely.

## 4. Substack Note (11 AM)

AgentKit's Agent Builder: drag-drop visual canvas for building agents.

Christina Huang (OpenAI) built working travel agent in 8 minutes live onstage. Not a demo - actual working agent with calendar integration.

The speed is real.

## 5. Substack Note (4 PM)

AgentKit includes Evals - you can test your agent workflows against Claude, Gemini, or other models.

This is huge: build on OpenAI, but verify it works with alternatives.

At least they're acknowledging model choice matters.

everywhere i go on X i am in the minority but i prefer claude code over cursor. better reasoning, handles complex tasks, doesn't give up.
