# Monday Nov 4 - Remaining 5 Pieces (Complete & Final)

## PIECE 3: Twitter Long-Form (2:15 PM)

**Content:**
```
the agent platform lock-in problem nobody's talking about.

agentkit (openai):
you build on their visual canvas. use their connectors. run on their runtime.

fast to ship. christina huang built working agent in 8 minutes live at devday.

but here's the lock-in:
• switch providers later? rebuild from scratch.
• need custom connector? wait for openai to build it.
• data locality requirements? can't, runs on their infra.
• pricing increases? you're stuck renegotiating.

@Consciogen called it: "you're renting, not building"

claude SDK (anthropic):
you write code. run on your servers. bring your own MCP integrations. self-host everything.

zero lock-in:
• swap models (gpt, claude, gemini) without changing architecture
• add custom tools via MCP anytime
• data stays on your infrastructure
• pricing independent (you control hosting)

the tradeoff: agentkit bets on openai winning long-term. claude SDK hedges.

i'd use agentkit for rapid validation. prove agent works in days.

but i'd architect knowing the claude SDK migration path. switching costs only increase.

optionality costs less than betting wrong.

## PIECE 4: Substack Note (11:00 AM)

**Content:**
```
AgentKit's Agent Builder demo was striking.

Christina Huang (OpenAI engineer) built complete travel agent live onstage in 8 minutes. Not slides. Not mockup. Working agent with calendar integration.

Drag-drop nodes. Connect tools. Deploy.

The speed advantage is real. Question is whether you're okay with the platform lock-in.

**Voice:** Balanced (shows advantage, notes tradeoff)

## PIECE 5: Substack Note (4:00 PM)

**Content:**
```
AgentKit includes Evals - test your agent workflows against Claude, Gemini, or other models. Not just GPT-5.

This is OpenAI acknowledging model choice matters.

You can build on their platform but verify it works with alternatives.

Strategic hedge or genuine flexibility? Time will tell.
```

**Metadata:** 281 chars
**Insight:** Most people miss the Evals multi-model testing

**Content:**
```
everywhere i go on X i am in the minority but i prefer claude code over cursor. better reasoning, handles complex tasks, doesn't give up.
```

**Metadata:** Your contrarian pattern
