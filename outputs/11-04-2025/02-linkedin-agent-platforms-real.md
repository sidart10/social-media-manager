## POST CONTENT

OpenAI and Anthropic both launched agent platforms in October. Here's the decision framework for product teams.

**What They Actually Are:**

**AgentKit (OpenAI, Oct 6):**
- Visual drag-drop builder for multi-step agents
- ChatKit for embedding chat in your apps
- Evals to test agent performance against different models
- Connector Registry for tool integrations

Built for: Fast iteration, visual workflows, managed runtime

**Claude Agent SDK (Anthropic, Sep 29):**
- Code-first framework (write code, not drag-drop)
- "Give Claude a computer" - bash, file editing, code execution
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) for tool integration
- Self-hosted (you run it on your infrastructure)

Built for: Full control, custom deployment, data locality

**The Strategic Difference:**

AgentKit = Centralized platform
• Faster to ship (8-minute demo, 2-hour builds reported)
• Managed runtime (OpenAI hosts everything)
• Lock-in risk (switching later = rebuild)

Claude SDK = Decentralized framework
• More setup work (code-first, self-host)
• Full control (your infrastructure, your rules)
• Model flexibility (swap models without platform migration)

**Real Enterprise Data:**

Ramp (using AgentKit): Cut dev time from 6 months → 6 weeks
Carlyle: 50% faster development, 30% better agent accuracy

These aren't promises. These are shipped production agents.

**The Critical Perspective:**

Twitter user @Consciogen: "You're not building with AgentKit. You're renting OpenAI's runtime, models, and connectors."

This matters for:
• Compliance teams (data locality requirements)
• Long-term strategy (platform dependency)
• Cost predictability (pricing changes affect you)

**Decision Framework:**

Choose AgentKit if:
• Small team needs fast validation
• Prototyping phase
• Visual workflows preferred
• Don't mind platform dependency

Choose Claude SDK if:
• Enterprise with compliance requirements
• Need data to stay on your infrastructure
• Want model flexibility (swap GPT/Claude/Gemini)
• Have engineering resources for setup

Choose BOTH:
• AgentKit for rapid prototyping
• Claude SDK for production deployment
• De-risk with optionality

**The Honest Reality:**

This is the new cloud platform decision. Once you build agents on one, switching costs are massive.

Most teams will pick based on immediate need (speed). Smart teams pick based on 3-year architecture.
