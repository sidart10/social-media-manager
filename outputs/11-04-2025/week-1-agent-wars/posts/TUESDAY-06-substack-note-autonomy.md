**Voice Mode**: Analyst
**Priority**: 2nd Priority

## NOTE (Copy-Ready)

Most "autonomous" AI agents aren't actually autonomous.

They're L2 (assisted autonomy) - suggest actions, wait for approval.

True L3 (conditional autonomy) - act independently within boundaries.

The difference?

L2 agent: "I found 3 solutions. Which should I implement?"
L3 agent: "I implemented solution #2 based on these criteria. Here's the audit trail."

We're building L2 and calling it L3. Production deployments are hitting 60% success rates because of this mismatch.

Autonomous â‰  independent action. Autonomous = reliable action within defined guardrails.

Most platforms (AgentKit, Claude SDK, Vertex AI) support L2 by default. L3 requires custom eval frameworks and extensive testing.

This is why demos look perfect but production struggles.

## NOTE ANALYSIS

**Character Count**: 682 chars (longer Note, still Twitter-compatible)
**Voice**: Analyst (frameworks, technical precision, honest assessment)
**Tone**: Educational + Corrective (fixing misconception)

**Why this works**:
- Defines important framework (L2 vs L3)
- Corrects industry hype
- Provides clear examples
- Explains production gap
- References current platforms

**Pattern used**: "Everyone says X, but actually Y" (corrective analysis)

**Key concept**: Autonomy levels framework (L0-L5, borrowed from autonomous vehicles)

## POSTING STRATEGY

**Platform**: Substack Notes
**Time**: 4 PM EST
**Why**: Afternoon, educational content for engaged readers

**Engagement Plan**:
1. Post to Notes
2. Reply to comments asking about autonomy levels with additional examples
3. Tease: "Full L0-L5 breakdown coming in next week's newsletter"

**Cross-Promotion**:
- Reference in tomorrow's LinkedIn post
- Links to LinkedIn reliability post from this morning
