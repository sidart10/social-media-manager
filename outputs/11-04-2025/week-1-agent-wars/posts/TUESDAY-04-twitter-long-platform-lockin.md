## POST (Copy-Ready)

The agent platform decision you make today is the cloud platform decision of 2015.

Once you build on one, switching is expensive. Here's why:

AgentKit (OpenAI), Claude SDK (Anthropic), and Vertex AI (Google) all launched agent toolkits in October 2025. This isn't coincidence - it's a land grab for developer mindshare.

**The abstraction trap:**

AgentKit uses visual workflows. Your entire agent logic lives in their proprietary canvas. To switch platforms, you'd have to rebuild from scratch.

Claude SDK is code-first. Your agent is... code. Portable. But switching still means rewriting tool integrations, changing MCP servers, migrating context handling.

Vertex AI ties you to Google Cloud. If your data's already there, great. If not, you're looking at a full infrastructure migration.

**The data gravity problem:**

Agents aren't stateless. They accumulate:
→ Training evals (thousands of test cases)
→ Custom tools (dozens of integrations)
→ Historical context (months of interactions)
→ Performance baselines (your quality benchmarks)

Carlyle invested 50% less development time using AgentKit. But they also built their entire eval framework on OpenAI's system. Switching now means losing that investment.

**The model dependency:**

AgentKit is optimized for GPT models. Claude SDK obviously works best with Claude. Vertex AI leverages Gemini.

You can technically use other models, but you lose:
- Native optimizations
- Integrated evals
- Platform-specific features
- Support guarantees

**This is the new AWS decision.**

In 2015, teams chose AWS vs Azure vs Google Cloud. Once in, migration was expensive enough that most never switched.

In 2025, you're choosing OpenAI vs Anthropic vs Google for agents. The switching costs will be similar.

**Choose carefully based on:**
1. Where your data already lives
2. Which model fits your use case
3. Control vs speed tradeoff
4. Long-term product trajectory

The fastest platform for prototypes might not be the best for production. And switching later is expensive.

This is why I'm testing all three. Week 1 of Agent Platform Wars continues tomorrow.

**Hook Quality**:
- Analogy to known decision (cloud platforms) ✓
- Creates urgency (expensive to switch) ✓
- Timely (all launched October 2025) ✓

**Structure**:
- Opening analogy (cloud decision) ✓
- 3 lock-in mechanisms (abstraction, data, model) ✓
- Real example (Carlyle) ✓
- Strategic framework (choose carefully based on...) ✓
- Personal credibility (testing all three) ✓
- Week 1 continuity mention ✓

**Data points used**:
- October 2025 launches (AgentKit, Claude SDK, Vertex AI)
- Carlyle 50% dev time reduction
- 2015 AWS decision comparison (relatable to tech audience)

**Voice**: Analyst mode (strategic thinking, frameworks, systems-level view)

**Key Angle**: Economic transparency - switching costs as strategic consideration

## VISUAL SUGGESTIONS

**Image 1** (Tweet attachment): Comparison chart showing lock-in factors
- Abstraction (AgentKit high, Claude SDK low)
- Data gravity (all high once you commit)
- Model dependency (all tied to their respective models)

**OR Meme**: "Choosing your agent platform in 2025" with Morpheus red/blue pill meme (AWS vs OpenAI)

## POSTING STRATEGY

**Platform**: Twitter (long-form)
**Best Time**: Tuesday 2:15 PM EST
**Why**: Afternoon technical deep-dive, allows morning content to breathe

**Engagement Plan**:
1. Post with chart/visual attached
2. First reply: "Testing all 3 platforms this week. Tomorrow: Google Vertex AI deep-dive. Stay tuned."
3. Pin this tweet for 24 hours (strategic importance)
4. Engage with replies about platform choices
5. Quote tweet on Wednesday with Vertex AI findings

**Hashtags**: #AI #CloudPlatforms #AgenticAI (minimal for long-form)
