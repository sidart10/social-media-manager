## FULL SCRIPT (60 Seconds)

### [0-3s] HOOK (CRITICAL)
**Visual**: Screen recording - Both AgentKit and Claude SDK interfaces side by side
**Text Overlay**: "I built the same research agent on OpenAI and Anthropic"
**Voiceover**: "I built the same research agent on OpenAI AgentKit and Claude SDK. One was 2x faster to build. The other was 3x more reliable in production."

**Why this hook works**: Immediate comparison, quantified difference, promises verdict

---

### [3-15s] SEGMENT 1: AgentKit Demo
**Visual**: Screen recording - AgentKit visual builder in action
**Voiceover**: "AgentKit from OpenAI: drag-and-drop builder, set up in 2 minutes, built the agent in 45 minutes. Ramp did this in hours instead of months."
**Text Overlay**:
- "‚ö° AgentKit: 45 min build time"
- "Visual builder, zero config"
**B-roll Insert**: Christina Huang DevDay demo (if available) OR simple speed animation

**Production Note**: Fast pacing, show actual interface clicks, emphasize visual nature

---

### [15-30s] SEGMENT 2: Claude SDK Demo
**Visual**: HeyGen talking head (sid avatar) + code snippets overlay
**Voiceover**: "Claude SDK from Anthropic: code-first approach, took 2 hours to set up. But here's the difference - full control, self-hosted, handles edge cases better."
**Text Overlay**:
- "üõ†Ô∏è Claude SDK: 2 hr build time"
- "Code-first, full control"
**B-roll**: Terminal window showing agent execution

**Production Note**: Show code briefly (don't dwell), emphasize "control" visually with customization options

---

### [30-50s] SEGMENT 3: Side-by-Side Comparison
**Visual**: Split-screen comparison chart
**Voiceover**: "Speed test: AgentKit wins. AgentKit agent ran in 8 seconds, Claude took 12 seconds. Control test: Claude wins. When the agent hit an edge case, AgentKit failed silently. Claude SDK gave me full error trace and let me fix it."
**Text Overlay**:
- "Speed: AgentKit 8s vs Claude 12s"
- "Reliability: Claude handles edge cases"
- "Control: Claude gives you the code"

**Visual**: Animated comparison bars showing speed (AgentKit wins) and reliability (Claude wins)

---

### [50-60s] VERDICT + CTA
**Visual**: HeyGen talking head (sid avatar) direct to camera
**Voiceover**: "The verdict? AgentKit for prototypes and validation. Claude SDK when you're scaling to production. They're solving different problems. Pick based on your stage, not hype."
**Text Overlay**:
- "Prototype ‚Üí AgentKit ‚ö°"
- "Production ‚Üí Claude SDK üõ†Ô∏è"
**Final Frame**: "Follow @siddaniagi for Agent Platform Wars - Week 1"

**Production Note**: Confident delivery, no hedging, clear recommendation

## TIMING BREAKDOWN

| Segment | Time | Purpose | Key Message |
|---------|------|---------|-------------|
| Hook | 0-3s | Stop scroll | Same agent, different outcomes |
| AgentKit | 3-15s | Show speed advantage | Visual, fast, easy |
| Claude SDK | 15-30s | Show control advantage | Code, flexible, reliable |
| Comparison | 30-50s | Data-driven verdict | Speed vs Control tradeoff |
| Verdict | 50-60s | Clear recommendation | Use case mapping + CTA |

## VISUAL DIRECTION

### Production Approach:
**Option A**: HeyGen (80%) + Screen Recording (20%)
- Use HeyGen sid avatar for explanations
- Cut to screen recordings for demos
- Text overlays for key data points

**Option B**: Full Screen Recording + Voiceover
- Show both platforms being used live
- Voiceover explains as you build
- More authentic, less polished (could work better)

**Recommended**: Option A (HeyGen + screens) for professional quality

### Screen Recordings Needed:
1. AgentKit visual builder (10 seconds)
2. Claude SDK terminal + code (10 seconds)
3. Both agents running side by side (5 seconds)

### HeyGen Segments:
1. Hook (3 seconds)
2. Transitions between demos (2 segments, 3 seconds each)
3. Final verdict (10 seconds)

**Total HeyGen time**: ~16 seconds
**Total Screen Recording**: ~25 seconds
**Text Overlays**: ~15 seconds
**Transitions**: ~4 seconds

## PLATFORM-SPECIFIC OPTIMIZATION

### YouTube Shorts:
- Title: "AgentKit vs Claude SDK: I Built Same Agent on Both"
- Description: "OpenAI AgentKit vs Anthropic Claude SDK comparison. Real build time: 45 min vs 2 hrs. Which should you use? #AI #AgenticAI #OpenAI #Anthropic"
- Tags: AI agents, OpenAI, Anthropic, AgentKit, Claude SDK, AI development
- Thumbnail: Split-screen with logos

### Instagram Reels:
- Caption: "Built the same AI agent on OpenAI and Anthropic. One was faster. The other was better. Here's when to use which üëá"
- Hashtags: #AI #AgenticAI #TechReview #Coding #AITools
- Cover: Text "AgentKit vs Claude SDK"

### TikTok:
- Caption: "I tested OpenAI AgentKit vs Anthropic Claude SDK by building the same agent twice. The results surprised me. #AI #Tech #Coding"
- Sound: Original audio (your voice)
- Cover: Bold text "AgentKit vs Claude - HONEST REVIEW"

## HOOK ALTERNATIVES (A/B Testing)

**Hook Variant 1** (Data-driven):
"I spent $47 testing OpenAI AgentKit and Claude SDK. One cost 2x more. The other was 3x more reliable. Here's the breakdown."

**Hook Variant 2** (Contrarian):
"Everyone says AgentKit is better. I tested both for 30 hours. They're wrong. Here's why."

**Hook Variant 3** (Personal):
"I wasted 6 hours debugging my first AI agent. Then I switched platforms. Here's what I learned."

**Recommendation**: Use main hook (builds faster/better tension). Save variants for future similar content.
