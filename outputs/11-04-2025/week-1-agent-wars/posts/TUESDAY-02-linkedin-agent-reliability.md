## POST (Copy-Ready)

AI agent demos succeed at 95%. Production deployments struggle to hit 60%. Here's the gap nobody's discussing.

OpenAI showed Christina Huang building an agent in 8 minutes live on stage. Ramp cut development from quarters to sprints. Carlyle improved accuracy by 30%.

These are real results. But they're also **prototypes**.

The demo-to-production gap is massive, and here's why:

**1. Context loss at scale**

Demos use clean, limited data.
Production has messy, interconnected systems.
Agents lose critical context when:
- Data spans multiple sources
- Edge cases outnumber happy paths
- Historical context matters

**2. Error handling isn't solved**

When demos fail, developers iterate.
When production fails, customers see it.

Current agent platforms lack:
→ Graceful degradation
→ Fallback logic that works
→ Clear error explanations to end users

**3. The testing problem**

You can't unit test emergent behavior.
Agents make dynamic decisions.
Traditional QA frameworks don't apply.

Carlyle's 30% accuracy improvement came from building custom eval frameworks. Most teams don't have that capacity.

**The L2 vs L3 reality:**

Most "autonomous" agents are L2 (assisted autonomy).
They can suggest actions, but need human approval.

True L3 (conditional autonomy) means acting independently within boundaries.
We're not there yet for most use cases.

**What's needed for production:**
- Monitoring (what is the agent actually doing?)
- Circuit breakers (kill switch when it goes wrong)
- Audit trails (trace every decision)
- Realistic success rate expectations (60-80%, not 95%)

The agent platform wars are heating up (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google all launched toolkits in October). But production readiness is still the real differentiator.

Speed to prototype? Solved.
Speed to production? Still figuring it out.
