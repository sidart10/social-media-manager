## THREAD (Copy-Ready)

**Tweet 1/6** (HOOK):
everyone's hyping ai agents. here's what they conveniently leave out üßµ

---

**Tweet 2/6** (LIMITATION 1):
Can't handle true edge cases.

AgentKit demo: research agent works perfectly on clean queries.
Production: User asks "find the blue thing from last Tuesday" ‚Üí agent breaks.

60% success rate in production vs 95% in demos. Gap is real.

---

**Tweet 3/6** (LIMITATION 2):
Can't debug themselves reliably.

Both AgentKit and Claude SDK fail silently on complex errors.

You get: "Task failed"
You need: "Failed because X called Y with Z parameter, here's the trace"

Carlyle spent 50% of time just building better error reporting.

---

**Tweet 4/6** (LIMITATION 3):
Can't explain failures clearly to end users.

Agent fails ‚Üí User sees: "Something went wrong, try again"

What they need: "I couldn't access your calendar because permission X is missing. Click here to fix."

This is an unsolved UX problem across all platforms.

---

**Tweet 5/6** (LIMITATION 4):
Cost at scale is still unclear.

Small team: $200/month in API calls
10K users: $???

Nobody's published real production cost data yet. Ramp cut dev time 70%, but what's their runtime bill?

Pricing opacity is intentional.

---

**Tweet 6/6** (VERDICT + CTA):
agents are production-ready for narrow, well-defined tasks.

research, summarization, simple automation? works.

complex multi-step workflows with edge cases? still experimental.

hype cycle vs reality. pick your battles.
