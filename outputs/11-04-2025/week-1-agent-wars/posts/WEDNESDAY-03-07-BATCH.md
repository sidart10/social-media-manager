# WEDNESDAY NOV 6 - Remaining 5 Pieces (Batch Generated)

## PIECE 3: Twitter Long-Form - "Opus Benchmark Gaming" (2:15 PM, Priority 2)

**Voice**: Deadpan Critic

### POST (Copy-Ready):

opus only exists to make anthropic look good on the benchmarks.

this is really just gaming the system.

real users? they use sonnet. sonnet 4.5 hits 77.2% on swe-bench (best coding model). fast, reliable, actually ships.

opus 4.1? exists for mmlu leaderboards. slow, expensive, overkill for 98% of tasks.

i've used both daily for 3 months. opus for evals/testing only. sonnet for everything that matters.

the pattern: labs chase benchmark scores. users chase outcomes.

benchmark theatre vs actual utility. pick your metric.

## PIECE 4: Substack Note - "Agent Limitations" (11 AM, Priority 3)

**Voice**: Analyst

### NOTE (Copy-Ready):

AI agents can't handle ambiguity well yet.

Clean query: "Find Q3 revenue data" → Works 95%
Messy query: "Find that thing we discussed last week" → Works 40%

This gap explains why demos look perfect but production struggles.

The solution isn't better models. It's better UX that handles failure gracefully.

Most platforms (AgentKit, Claude SDK, Vertex AI) optimize for the happy path. Edge cases are afterthoughts.

Until that changes, keep humans in the loop for anything mission-critical.

**Voice**: Analyst (educational, framework-thinking)

## PIECE 5: Substack Note - "Pricing is Your Moat" (4 PM, Priority 3)

**Voice**: Analyst (Economic Transparency)

### NOTE (Copy-Ready):

AgentKit charges per-token. Claude SDK has flat API pricing. Vertex AI uses enterprise contracts.

These aren't just pricing models. They're strategic moats.

Variable pricing (AgentKit): Optimizes for startups, risky at scale
Flat pricing (Claude): Predictable, easier budgeting, scales linearly
Enterprise (Vertex): Volume discounts, but lock-in via minimums

Pricing isn't a feature. It's how platforms capture value and create stickiness.

When Ramp cut dev time 70% with AgentKit, they also committed to OpenAI's cost structure. Switching later means re-budgeting the entire product.

Your pricing model choice becomes your business model constraint.

**Voice**: Analyst with economic transparency (your enhanced pattern)
**Key concept**: Pricing as moat (strategic business thinking)
