## PIECE 1: Twitter Thread - "MCP Explained" (8:30 AM, Priority 1)

**Voice**: Analyst

### THREAD (Copy-Ready):

**Tweet 1/7** (HOOK):
MCP (model context protocol) is the universal translator for ai agents. here's why it matters 🧵

---

**Tweet 2/7**:
The problem MCP solves:

Every AI agent needs tools (Google Drive, GitHub, Slack, etc.).
Before MCP: Build custom integration for each tool × each platform.
After MCP: One standardized protocol. Build once, works everywhere.

---

**Tweet 3/7**:
How it works:

MCP servers = connectors to tools
MCP clients = agents that use those tools

Claude SDK, AgentKit, even open-source frameworks support MCP.

You build a Notion MCP server once → works with Claude, GPT, Gemini, all of them.

---

**Tweet 4/7**:
Why this is huge:

Before: 100 tools × 5 platforms = 500 integrations needed
After: 100 MCP servers × 1 protocol = works with any MCP client

Anthropic open-sourced the protocol. OpenAI adopted it. Google supports it.

Rare moment of industry cooperation.

---

**Tweet 5/7**:
Real usage:

At Samba TV, we use MCP for:
→ Internal data access
→ Third-party API integrations
→ Custom tool connectors

Build it once, use across Claude SDK and AgentKit agents.

Portability is the win.

---

**Tweet 6/7**:
The ecosystem:

50+ MCP servers already exist (open source):
• Slack, GitHub, Google Drive, Notion
• Database connectors (Postgres, MongoDB)
• Custom tool examples

Growing fast. Community-driven.

---

**Tweet 7/7** (VERDICT):
MCP is to AI agents what HTTP was to the web.

standardized protocol → ecosystem explodes.

if you're building agents, learn MCP. it's the only way to avoid platform lock-in for your tools.

## PIECE 2: LinkedIn Post - "Week 1 Synthesis: What I Learned" (9 AM, Priority 1)

**Voice**: Analyst

### POST (Copy-Ready):

Week 1: Agent Platform Wars - Here's what I learned testing AgentKit, Claude SDK, and Vertex AI.

**The verdict nobody wants to hear:**

There's no universal "best" platform. Each solves different problems.

After building the same agents on all three, here's my framework:

**1. AgentKit (OpenAI) wins on speed**

• 45-min first agent (vs 2 hrs for Claude)
• Visual builder (non-technical teams can use)
• Managed runtime (zero DevOps)

Real results: Ramp cut dev cycles 70%, Canva saved 2 weeks frontend work.

But: Vendor lock-in, debugging is opaque, production concerns remain.

**Use for**: Prototypes, validation, non-technical teams

**2. Claude SDK (Anthropic) wins on control**

• Code-first, self-hosted
• Full bash access, custom MCP servers
• Powers "almost all major loops" at Anthropic

Tradeoff: 2-hour setup, requires engineering capacity.

But: Production-ready, portable code, compliance-friendly.

**Use for**: Production deployments, custom requirements, technical teams

**3. Vertex AI (Google) wins for enterprises on GCP**

• Native integration with Google Cloud
• Enterprise SLAs, IAM, audit logs
• Model flexibility (Gemini, Claude, open source)

Tradeoff: Complexity, steep learning curve, higher initial costs.

But: If you're already on GCP, obvious choice.

**Use for**: Enterprise deployments with existing Google infrastructure

**Three key insights from this week:**

**Insight 1: The reliability gap is real**
• Demos: 95% success
• Production: 60-80% success
• Gap comes from ambiguous queries, edge cases, error handling

**Insight 2: Lock-in is inevitable**
• Evals, tools, integrations tie you to a platform
• This is the AWS decision of 2025
• Choose based on 3-5 year trajectory, not quarterly goals

**Insight 3: Cost models are strategic**
• Variable (AgentKit): Good for validation, scary at scale
• Flat (Claude): Predictable budgeting
• Enterprise (Vertex): Volume discounts but minimum commits

Pricing isn't operations. It's strategy.

**My personal choice:**

I'm using Claude SDK for production (control + compliance).
AgentKit for rapid prototyping new ideas.

But I'm a technical PM who can code. If you're not, AgentKit makes more sense.

**The meta-lesson:**

Agent platforms are infrastructure decisions, not tool choices.

Treat this like choosing your cloud provider in 2015. Once you commit, switching is expensive.

Test multiple platforms now while you're small. Lock in when you hit product-market fit.

What platform did you choose and why? Share your decision criteria below.

## PIECE 3: VIDEO SCRIPT - "Agent Platform Decision Guide" (2 PM, Priority 1)

**Duration**: 60 seconds
**Platforms**: YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels, TikTok

### SCRIPT:

**[0-3s] HOOK**:
**Visual**: Decision tree animation
**Voiceover**: "I tested OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google agent platforms. Here's how to choose in 60 seconds."
**Text**: "Which agent platform should YOU use?"

**[3-20s] DECISION TREE**:
**Visual**: Animated flowchart
**Voiceover**: "Ask yourself 3 questions. First: Do you need to ship in days or weeks? Days → AgentKit. OpenAI's visual builder gets you live in hours. Weeks → Claude SDK or Vertex AI."
**Text Overlay**:
- "Q1: Days or weeks?"
- "Days → AgentKit ⚡"

**[20-37s] QUESTION 2**:
**Voiceover**: "Second question: Do you need full control of your code and data? Yes → Claude SDK. Self-hosted, you own everything. No → AgentKit or Vertex AI work fine."
**Text Overlay**:
- "Q2: Need full control?"
- "Yes → Claude SDK 🛠️"

**[37-50s] QUESTION 3**:
**Voiceover**: "Third: Are you already on Google Cloud? Yes → Vertex AI wins on integration. No → AgentKit for speed or Claude SDK for control."
**Text Overlay**:
- "Q3: On Google Cloud?"
- "Yes → Vertex AI ☁️"

**[50-60s] VERDICT**:
**Visual**: HeyGen avatar direct to camera
**Voiceover**: "Speed → AgentKit. Control → Claude SDK. Enterprise → Vertex AI. But test before you commit. This is a 3-5 year decision, not a quarterly one."
**Text**: "Test multiple. Commit strategically."

**Estimated cost**: $0 (HeyGen free tier)

## PIECE 4: Twitter Long - "Week 1 Learnings" (2:15 PM, Priority 2)

**Voice**: Analyst

### POST (Copy-Ready):

Week 1: Agent Platform Wars complete. 6 days testing AgentKit, Claude SDK, and Vertex AI. Here's what actually matters.

**The speed vs control tradeoff is real.**

AgentKit: 45 min to first agent. Claude SDK: 2 hours. Vertex AI: 4 hours (GCP setup).

But speed to prototype ≠ speed to production.

AgentKit agents hit production challenges (debugging, error handling). Claude SDK agents needed more setup but fewer production rewrites.

**Lock-in is the hidden cost.**

Ramp saved 70% dev time with AgentKit. But they also committed to OpenAI's cost structure, eval framework, and GPT model dependency.

Switching later means losing that investment.

**The L2 vs L3 gap is the real bottleneck.**

Most "autonomous" agents are L2 (assisted). They suggest, you approve.

True L3 (acts independently within guardrails) requires eval frameworks that don't exist yet.

Production success rates (60-80%) reflect this reality.

**What I'm changing next week:**

Testing multi-agent coordination (Era 4).
Building better error handling.
Measuring real costs at scale.

Agent platforms are infrastructure. Choose like you chose AWS in 2015.

But the real decision is: what happens when you need to switch?

Platform lock-in is the 2025 version of cloud vendor lock-in.
