## PERFORMANCE TRACKING

- Likes
- Comments
- Shares/Retweets

"Update stats for yesterday's posts"
```

Jarvis will:
- Fetch metrics from platform APIs
- Update Notion entries
- Calculate View Performance (Great/Good/Okay/Poor)
- Log in memories.md

### Week 1 Analysis (Sunday Nov 10):
```
"Analyze Week 1 performance and generate insights report"
```

Output: `outputs/11-10-2025/week-1-performance-analysis.md`

---

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

### Publishing Goals:
- ✅ Post 35+ pieces (37 generated, buffer included)
- ✅ No missed days (content ready for all 5 days)
- ✅ 3 videos produced and published
- ✅ 2 carousels published

### Quality Goals:
- Voice consistency (Analyst, Lowercase, Critic modes applied correctly)
- Data accuracy (all claims verified)
- Platform optimization (character limits, formatting, hooks)
- Engagement elements (CTAs, questions, visual breaks)

### Learning Goals:
- Identify which voice mode performs best
- Determine optimal posting times
- Measure carousel vs text-only LinkedIn performance
- Assess video retention rates
- Track which topics drive most engagement

---

## RISK MITIGATION

### Risk 1: Can't produce videos in time
**Mitigation**: Videos optional. If AI Video Agent delayed, skip videos Week 1. Focus on text content (34 pieces still substantial).

### Risk 2: Carousel production issues
**Mitigation**: Post LinkedIn without carousel (still strong content). Add carousel later as edit if needed.

### Risk 3: Volume feels overwhelming
**Mitigation**: Skip Priority 3 pieces (16 pieces). Focus on Priority 1+2 (21 pieces). Still hits 4+ posts/day.

### Risk 4: Content doesn't match voice
**Mitigation**: Review every Priority 1 piece carefully. Priority 2-3 can be posted with minor edits.

### Risk 5: Platforms hit rate limits
**Mitigation**: Social Posting Agent checks limits before posting. Space out if needed.
