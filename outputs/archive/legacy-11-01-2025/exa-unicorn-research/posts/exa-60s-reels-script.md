## HOOK VARIANTS (A/B Test Options)

If primary hook doesn't test well, try:

**Variant A (Number-focused):**
"$50 million. One investor. One company. Here's why."

**Variant B (Pattern-breaking):**
"When a top VC breaks their own rules, you pay attention."

**Variant C (Curiosity gap):**
"Benchmark never does this. Until they did. The company? You've never heard of it."

**Test Strategy**: Run all 3 variants, measure retention at 3s mark, keep winner.
