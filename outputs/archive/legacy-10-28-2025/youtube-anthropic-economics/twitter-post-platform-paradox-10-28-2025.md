## POST TEXT

Anthropic keeps saying they're "platform-first" while launching Claude.ai, Claude Code, Claude for Excel, Claude for Financial Services.

So which is it? Platform or application company?

Turns out: both. And Dario Amodei's explanation of WHY reveals one of the smartest strategic frameworks I've seen.

Here's what's actually happening:

THE FOUNDATION: CLAUDE.AI CAME FIRST

Before building anything else, Anthropic launched Claude.ai—a consumer chatbot competing directly with ChatGPT. Not a platform play. A product.

This set the pattern: build first-party applications to understand how people actually use the model. Then use those insights to make the API better for everyone.

THE VERTICAL EXPANSION: WHY CLAUDE CODE EXISTS

February 2025. Anthropic launches Claude Code—their first developer-focused vertical. This seemed weird. Why would a "platform company" build a coding tool when Cursor, Windsurf, and dozens of others were already building on their API?

Dario's answer from the Stripe podcast: "The people who write code are very socially and technically adjacent to the folks who develop AI models."

Translation: developers adopt new tech in 2 hours. Enterprises take 2 years.

Claude Code wasn't just a product. It was a testing ground. The fastest possible feedback loop for understanding what the model needs to do.

And it worked. Claude Code now generates $500M+ in annual revenue and grew 10x since May 2025.

THE FRAMEWORK: THREE REASONS TO BUILD FIRST-PARTY APPS

Dario gave John Collison three explicit reasons why platform companies should selectively build applications:

Reason 1: Direct User Exposure

Quote: "The end user gives you some sense of how exactly are they using it, what are they most looking for. If you're a pure platform and you don't have that direct connection, you can be disadvantaged."

Without seeing how users actually interact with your model, you don't know where to improve it. The API abstracts away the user behavior.

Reason 2: Model Improvement Insights

Quote: "It may even be hard to know where the model really, really needs to go. There are many models that seem to be good at coding, but they aren't good in the way that's actually relevant."

Building Claude Code taught them what "good at coding" actually means in practice. Not benchmark scores. Real developer workflows.

Reason 3: Enterprise Ease-of-Use

Traditional companies struggle to build on APIs. They need pre-built solutions or kits to get started. First-party apps lower the barrier to entry for slower-moving but higher-value customers.

THE REAL EXAMPLE: CLAUDE FOR EXCEL

October 2025. Anthropic launches Claude for Excel with 1,000 beta users.

This is fascinating because there are already companies building spreadsheet AI tools on Claude's API. Anthropic is now competing with their own ecosystem partners.

But here's the play: Excel integration gives them access to how financial analysts, accountants, and business users actually work with AI. That data feeds back into making Claude's platform better for ALL financial use cases—including the ones built by ecosystem partners.

It's not zero-sum competition. It's strategic ecosystem positioning.

THE HISTORICAL PRECEDENT: AWS DID THIS

Dario compared Anthropic to cloud companies. AWS is the perfect example.

AWS built SageMaker (machine learning platform), Lambda (serverless compute), dozens of vertical services—all while being the dominant infrastructure platform.

Did this kill their ecosystem? No. It made the ecosystem stronger because AWS understood customer needs better.

The pattern: Build enough first-party apps to understand user behavior deeply. Use those insights to improve the platform. The ecosystem wins because the platform gets better.

THE COUNTERARGUMENT: PURE PLATFORM IS A TRAP

Here's Dario's most provocative point: "If you're a pure platform and you don't have that direct connection, you can be disadvantaged in various ways. It's hard to build the best products."

Pure platform companies lose the feedback signal that tells them what to build next.

They're flying blind. Making guesses about what developers need based on support tickets and feature requests instead of watching real usage patterns.

This is why Anthropic will keep building selective first-party apps. Not to capture all the value from their ecosystem. Because they NEED to see how people actually use Claude to make the platform better for everyone.

THE ANTHROPIC DOCTRINE

So here's the framework:

Platform-first strategy doesn't mean platform-only execution.

Build first-party apps when:

1. You need direct user exposure to improve the core product
2. The vertical has fast adoption velocity (perfect testing ground)
3. The enterprise market needs pre-built solutions (lower friction)

Keep building the platform when:

1. Partners can reach markets you can't
2. Ecosystem innovation exceeds what you could build internally
3. The use case doesn't provide unique model improvement insights

Anthropic's play: Be platform-first in mindset, but strategically application-present in execution.

Use first-party apps as "sensors" that make your platform smarter. Feed those insights back into the API. Create a flywheel.

This is how you compete with OpenAI (who's building ChatGPT plugins), Google (who's building Workspace integrations), and Meta (who's building consumer apps).

Not by being purely platform OR purely application. By being strategically both.

The companies that figure this out will win the AI platform wars.

## HOOK VARIANTS (For Testing)

**Original Hook:**
"Anthropic keeps saying they're 'platform-first' while launching Claude Code, Claude for Excel, Claude for Financial Services. So which is it? Platform or application company?"

**Variant 1: Bold Declaration**
"Pure platform companies will lose the AI wars. Here's why Anthropic is building apps despite claiming 'platform-first'—and why they're right."

**Variant 2: Number Hook**
"Dario Amodei gave 3 reasons why platform companies must build apps. Every AI founder needs to understand this framework."

**Variant 3: Controversy Hook**
"Anthropic is competing with its own ecosystem (Claude for Excel). Sounds like a bad idea. It's actually brilliant. Here's the strategy investors are missing."

**Recommendation:** Test Original (clearest framing of paradox) or Variant 3 (most provocative)
