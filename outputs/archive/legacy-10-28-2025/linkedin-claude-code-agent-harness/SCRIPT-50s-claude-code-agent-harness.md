## Full Script with Timing

### [0:00-0:03] HOOK (3 seconds)

**SCRIPT:**
"Claude Code isn't a coding tool. It's the first real harness for AI agents. Here's why:"

**[VISUAL DIRECTION]:**

- Shot: You at desk, direct to camera
- Style: Confident, matter-of-fact
- Movement: Static or slow push-in

**[ON-SCREEN TEXT]:**

- "CLAUDE CODE = AGENT INFRASTRUCTURE" (large, bold)
- Appears at 0:01, stays through 0:03

**[AUDIO/MUSIC]:**

- Start with your voice immediately (no music intro)
- Background music starts at 0:02 (subtle, tech-focused)

---

### [0:03-0:13] BEAT 1: The Problem (10 seconds)

**SCRIPT:**
"Building AI agents used to mean custom APIs, fragile integrations, and no standard protocol. Most agents fail in production because they can't manage context reliably."

**[VISUAL DIRECTION]:**

- Screen recording: Messy code with multiple API integrations (2s)
- Quick cuts to different failed agent demos (3s)
- Back to you explaining (5s)

**[ON-SCREEN TEXT]:**

- "90% OF AGENTS FAIL" appears at 0:08
- Small text underneath: "context management problem"

**[TRANSITION]:**
Hard cut to next beat

---

### [0:13-0:23] BEAT 2: The Solution (10 seconds)

**SCRIPT:**
"Anthropic solved it with three layers: MCP protocol for universal tool connections, the Agent SDK for infrastructure, and Skills for reusable knowledge."

**[VISUAL DIRECTION]:**

- Animated diagram appears showing three layers stacking
- Or simple text-based visual hierarchy
- Clean, minimal design

**[ON-SCREEN TEXT]:**

```
Layer 1: MCP
Layer 2: Agent SDK
Layer 3: Skills
```

Each layer appears as you mention it (0:15, 0:17, 0:20)

**[GRAPHIC NEEDED]:**
Three-layer architecture stack (vertical bars or boxes)

---

### [0:23-0:33] BEAT 3: The Innovation - Context Engineering (10 seconds)

**SCRIPT:**
"The key innovation? Context engineering. Claude Code uses filesystem-based context management, not vector databases. It's transparent, maintainable, and actually works at scale."

**[VISUAL DIRECTION]:**

- Split screen: Filesystem structure (left) vs complex vector DB diagram (right)
- Filesystem glows/highlights (showing it's the winner)
- Or: Terminal showing bash commands (grep, tail)

**[ON-SCREEN TEXT]:**

- "FILESYSTEM > VECTOR DBs" at 0:28
- Checkmarks appear: "✓ Transparent ✓ Maintainable"

---

### [0:33-0:43] BEAT 4: The Proof (10 seconds)

**SCRIPT:**
"The results speak: $400 million ARR in five months. Enterprise teams at Salesforce, Uber, and Deloitte use it. And agents run autonomously for 30+ hours without breaking."

**[VISUAL DIRECTION]:**

- Stats appearing on screen rapidly:
  - "$400M ARR" (0:35)
  - "Salesforce · Uber · Deloitte" logos or text (0:37)
  - "30+ HOURS AUTONOMOUS" (0:40)

**[ON-SCREEN TEXT]:**
Large numbers dominate:

- "$400M" (2s display)
- "30+ HOURS" (2s display)
- Company names scroll or appear sequentially

---

### [0:43-0:47] BEAT 5: The Unlock - Democratization (4 seconds)

**SCRIPT:**
"September 2025: they released the Agent SDK. Same infrastructure Anthropic uses, now available to anyone."

**[VISUAL DIRECTION]:**

- Code snippet or terminal showing SDK usage
- Or: Simple text "SEPT 2025: AGENT SDK RELEASED"

**[ON-SCREEN TEXT]:**

- "AGENT SDK"
- "ANYONE CAN BUILD"

---

### [0:47-0:50] CTA (3 seconds)

**SCRIPT:**
"This isn't a coding tool. It's infrastructure for autonomous AI."

**[VISUAL DIRECTION]:**

- Back to you, direct eye contact
- Slight smile or nod (confident energy)

**[ON-SCREEN TEXT]:**

- "FOLLOW FOR MORE" or platform-specific CTA
- Arrow pointing to follow button

**[AUDIO]:**

- Music subtle swell
- Clear, emphatic delivery

---

## Alternative Hook Variants (A/B Testing)

**Original Hook:**
"Claude Code isn't a coding tool. It's the first real harness for AI agents. Here's why:"

**Variant 1 (Question Hook):**
"Why are Salesforce, Uber, and Deloitte using a 'coding tool' for legal work, marketing, and security?"

**Variant 2 (Stat Hook):**
"$400 million in 5 months. Zero to fastest-growing AI tool. Here's the infrastructure everyone missed:"

**Variant 3 (Contrarian Hook):**
"Everyone's comparing Claude Code to Cursor. They're missing the point—it's not even in the same category."

## Voice Analysis - Script Adherence

**Voice Mode Used:** Analyst

- Proper capitalization ✓
- Technical terminology (MCP, Agent SDK, context engineering) ✓
- Framework organization (three layers) ✓
- Specific companies named (Salesforce, Uber, Deloitte) ✓
- Data enumeration ($400M, 30+ hours) ✓
- "Here's why" opening (your pattern) ✓

**Avoided:**

- Generic tech buzzwords ✓
- Overly formal language ✓
- Hedging ("might", "possibly") ✓
- Lowercase for this mode ✓

**Signature Elements:**

- Direct declarations
- Enumeration for proof
- Technical credibility
- Clear winner declared (filesystem > vector DBs)

## Alternative: Lowercase Builder-Philosopher Version (If Preferred)

If you want your casual Twitter voice instead:

**[0:00-0:03] HOOK:**
"claude code hit $400m arr in five months. but calling it a coding tool misses everything."

**[0:03-0:10] BEAT 1:**
"most ai tools are assistants. claude code became infrastructure. different category entirely."

**[0:10-0:20] BEAT 2:**
"it solved the harness problem: mcp for tools, agent sdk for the foundation, skills for knowledge. that's the stack."

**[0:20-0:30] BEAT 3:**
"context engineering beats prompt engineering. filesystem over vector databases. transparent, maintainable, actually works."

**[0:30-0:40] BEAT 4:**
"salesforce uses it. uber uses it. not for coding. for autonomous agents that run 30+ hours without breaking."

**[0:40-0:47] BEAT 5:**
"september 2025: agent sdk released. same infrastructure anthropic uses. anyone can build now."

**[0:47-0:50] CTA:**
"this is the harness everyone's been looking for."

**This version:**

- Lowercase (casual voice signal)
- Shorter sentences
- Direct declarations
- Your Twitter energy
- Still technical, just less formal

---

**Which version do you prefer?**

1. Analyst (proper caps, structured) - what I wrote above
2. Builder-Philosopher (lowercase, punchy) - this alternative

I can also create BOTH and you pick which feels right!
