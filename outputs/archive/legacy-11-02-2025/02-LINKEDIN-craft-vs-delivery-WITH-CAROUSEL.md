## POST TEXT

Why do some developers love AI coding tools while others hate them?

It's not about skill level. It's about philosophy.

After watching months of AI coding debates on X, the pattern is clear: There are two types of developers. And AI reveals which camp you're in.

**Craft-Focused Developers:**

These developers enjoy the process of writing code.
• Programming is creative expression
• The journey matters as much as destination
• AI feels like it removes the satisfying parts
• Code quality is intrinsically valuable

For them, AI is like having someone else solve your crossword puzzle. Sure, you get the answer faster. But you lost the fun.

**Delivery-Focused Developers:**

These developers care about shipping products.
• Programming is a means to an end
• The product matters, code is just the path
• AI removes friction between ideas and reality
• Shipping working software is the measure

For us, AI isn't removing joy - it's removing obstacles between ideas and users.

**This Isn't About Experience:**

I've seen senior architects who are craft-focused.
I've seen junior developers who are delivery-focused.

Years of experience doesn't determine which type you are. Your relationship with the work does.

**The Real Tension:**

Craft developers have a valid concern:

If AI handles all the "easy" parts, your job becomes constant struggle with hard problems. No warm-up tasks. No satisfying flow from simple to complex.

That's exhausting.

Delivery developers counter:

We never enjoyed boilerplate. We want time for architecture, user experience, business logic - the parts that actually matter for users.

AI frees us to focus on what creates value.

**My Position:**

I'm delivery-focused. I learned to code to build products, not to enjoy syntax.

I use AI to skip boring parts (CRUD, boilerplate, repetitive tasks) and get to interesting parts (architecture, optimization, solving novel problems).

The outcome: I ship faster. I build more. I have products real people use.

That's what matters to me.

But I respect craft-focused developers. If you love the process, AI removing parts of it is a genuine loss.

**For Product Leaders:**

When hiring, know which type you need:

Building new products fast? → Hire delivery-focused devs who embrace AI
Maintaining complex systems? → Hire craft-focused devs who love deep work

Both are valuable. Different optimizations.

Which are you? Craft-focused or delivery-focused?

**Slide 4: What Each Values**

```
Title: "The Split"

Table comparison:

              CRAFT      DELIVERY
Process       ✓✓✓        ✓
Product       ✓          ✓✓✓
Code Quality  ✓✓✓        ✓✓
Shipping Fast ✓          ✓✓✓
Learning      ✓✓✓        ✓

```

**Slide 5: Hiring Framework**

```
Title: "Which Type Does Your Team Need?"

Decision Tree:

Building new products fast?
  → Hire Delivery-Focused
  → They embrace AI

Maintaining complex systems?
  → Hire Craft-Focused
  → They love deep work

Both types valuable.
Different optimizations.

Visual: Simple decision tree with Y/N branches
Style: Flow chart, clear paths
