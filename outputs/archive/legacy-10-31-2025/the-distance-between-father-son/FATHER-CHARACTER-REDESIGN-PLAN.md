# Father Character Redesign Plan

## Corrections Based on User Feedback

**Date**: October 31, 2025
**Issue**: Current father references are too stereotypical, mustache too thick, clothing too traditional

---

## 🔍 User Feedback Analysis

### Problems Identified:

1. **Mustache too thick** - Currently looks like handlebar/bushy style
2. **"Too Indian"** - Character feels stereotypical rather than universal
3. **Traditional clothing** - Kurta is too culture-specific
4. **Needs "normal man clothes"** - Everyday universal clothing

### What User Wants:

✅ **Subtle thin mustache** - Like 70s/80s style, barely there
✅ **Universal appearance** - South Asian heritage but not stereotypical
✅ **Normal everyday clothes** - T-shirt, jeans, flannel, button-up (not kurta)
✅ **Less "ethnic costume"** - More relatable, everyday father figure
✅ **Same person across ages** - Just aging, not changing

## 🚫 What to Avoid

### Mustache:

❌ Thick bushy mustache
❌ Handlebar style
❌ Walrus mustache
❌ Salvador Dali curves
✅ **Thin pencil mustache** (like Tom Selleck but thinner)
✅ **Barely there upper lip hair**
✅ **Subtle, doesn't dominate face**

### Clothing:

❌ Kurta (too traditional/ethnic)
❌ Traditional Indian clothing
❌ Ornate/decorative garments
❌ "Ethnic costume" feel
✅ **T-shirt, jeans, flannel** (universal)
✅ **Work clothes** (carpenter/craftsman)
✅ **Everyday dad outfit**

### Overall Appearance:

❌ Stereotypically Indian caricature
❌ Exaggerated ethnic features
❌ "Costume-y" presentation
✅ **Universal father figure** who happens to be South Asian
✅ **Relatable everyman**
✅ **Could be anyone's dad**
