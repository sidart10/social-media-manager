# FACT-CHECK RESULTS - CORRECTIONS NEEDED

## PRICING DATA - INCORRECT IN BOTH PIECES

### What I Wrote (WRONG):

- GPT-5: $0.03 per 1K tokens
- Claude Sonnet 4.5: $0.05 per 1K tokens
- Claude Haiku 4.5: $0.015 per 1K tokens
- Gemini 2.5 Pro: $0.07 per 1K tokens

### ACTUAL PRICING (Per Million Tokens, Oct 2025):

**GPT-5:**

- Input: $1.25 per million ($0.00125 per 1K)
- Output: $10 per million ($0.01 per 1K)
- Blended average: ~$0.006 per 1K

**Claude Sonnet 4.5:**

- Input: $3 per million ($0.003 per 1K)
- Output: $15 per million ($0.015 per 1K)
- Blended average: ~$0.009 per 1K

**Claude Haiku 4.5:**

- Input: $1 per million ($0.001 per 1K)
- Output: $5 per million ($0.005 per 1K)
- Blended average: ~$0.003 per 1K

**CONCLUSION:** My pricing was off by 2-5x. Need to correct both pieces.

## BENCHMARK SCORES - NEED VERIFICATION

### What I Wrote:

- GPT-5: 90.2% MMLU, 94.6% AIME
- Claude Sonnet 4.5: 77.2% SWE-Bench (82% with parallelization)

### From Research:

- ✅ Claude 4.5: 77.2-82% SWE-Bench (CONFIRMED from source)
- ⚠️ GPT-5: 90.2% MMLU, 94.6% AIME (stated in research but need to verify source)

**Status:** Claude numbers verified, GPT-5 numbers from research but should double-check

---

## CONTEXT WINDOWS - NEED VERIFICATION

### What I Wrote:

- Gemini: 1M tokens
- Claude: 1M tokens
- GPT-5: 200K tokens

### Verification Needed:

- Checking actual context window sizes from official sources

## RECOMMENDATIONS

**Option 1: Fix Now**

- Correct pricing in both pieces before publishing
- Verify all numbers against official sources
- Update Notion entries with corrected content

**Option 2: Use Ranges Instead**

- "GPT-5 starts at ~$0.001 per 1K input tokens"
- Avoid specific numbers that could be wrong
- Safer but less impactful

**Option 3: Remove Pricing**

- Focus on capabilities, not costs
- Avoid fact-check issues
- Loses economic transparency angle (your enhanced pattern)

**My Recommendation:** Option 1 - Fix now with correct pricing. Economic transparency is your edge, but needs to be accurate.

## CORRECTIONS TO MAKE

### Twitter Thread (Piece 1):

**Tweet 4 - Replace with:**
"Pricing reality (per 1K tokens, blended):

GPT-5: ~$0.006 (cheapest for high volume)
Claude Sonnet 4.5: ~$0.009 (premium)
Claude Haiku 4.5: ~$0.003 (disruptive - half the cost of GPT-5)

Haiku just changed the game on cost-performance."

### LinkedIn Post (Piece 2):

**Cost Structure Section - Replace with:**
"Pay attention to unit economics (per 1K tokens, blended):

• GPT-5: ~$0.006 (cheapest frontier model)
• Claude Sonnet 4.5: ~$0.009 (premium for best reasoning)
• Claude Haiku 4.5: ~$0.003 (half GPT-5's cost, similar capabilities)
• Gemini 2.5 Pro: [Verify - likely $0.005-0.01 range]

Pricing isn't a feature. It's your moat or your vulnerability."

## SHOULD I:

1. ✅ **Correct both pieces now** with accurate pricing?
2. ⚠️ **Verify context windows and Gemini pricing** too?
3. ✅ **Update Notion** with corrected versions?

**Say "Fix it" and I'll correct everything with verified data.**
