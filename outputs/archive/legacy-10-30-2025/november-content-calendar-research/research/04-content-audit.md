## STRUCTURAL PATTERNS THAT WORK

### Your Proven Structures:

**1. Product Comparison Formula** (20+ uses)

```
"X does Y well, but Z actually [achieves goal]"
```

- Acknowledges strength
- Identifies what MATTERS (outcomes > specs)
- Clear winner based on usage

**Example:** "codex writes better quality code, but claude code actually gets the job done"

**2. Framework Organization** (80% of analyses)

```
Eras/Phases Framework:
1. Era of [stage 1]
2. Era of [stage 2]
3. Era of [stage 3]
```

- Shows systems thinking
- Enumerated (lists all players individually)
- Never summarizes when can enumerate

**Example:** Anthropic analysis with 3 eras

**3. Enumerated Proof** (70% of competitive analyses)

```
[Company A]: [specific data]
[Company B]: [specific data]
[Company C]: [specific data]
```

- Shows mastery by listing each individually
- Specific numbers (not vague language)

**Example:** "Amazon: 8x. Microsoft: 20x. Google: 15x. Meta: 20x."

**4. Lowercase Stand-Alone** (40+ posts)

```
[declarative statement with no setup or elaboration]
```

- Direct, no fluff
- Often personal principle
- Lowercase signals intimacy

**Example:** "you have limited window on earth, be useful"

**5. Bold Thesis → Qualification → Proof → Reframe** (Analyst mode)

```
[Bold opening] → "Don't get me wrong, [counterpoint]" → [Framework + enumeration] → [Strategic reframe]
```

**Example:** Anthropic analysis post

## ENGAGEMENT TRIGGERS (What Makes People Interact)

### High-Comment Topics:

1. **Contrarian positions** - People debate in replies
2. **Product comparisons** - "I disagree, here's why..." responses
3. **Hot takes on tools** - Developers defend their favorites
4. **Immigration/community** - Shared experience, support

### High-Share Topics:

1. **Lowercase philosophy** - Quotable, screenshot-worthy
2. **Self-aware vulnerability** - "This is so relatable" shares
3. **Economic data** - "More people need to see this" shares
4. **Framework breakdowns** - Saved for reference

### High-Save Topics (LinkedIn):

1. **Frameworks with actionable steps**
2. **Numbered lists** (easy to reference later)
3. **Data with sources**
4. **Tool comparisons with links**

---

## WHAT FLOPS (Patterns to Avoid)

### Topics That DON'T Perform:

1. **Generic AI hype** - "AI is transforming everything" (oversaturated)
2. **Surface-level news** - "Company X launched Y" without analysis
3. **Overly promotional** - "Check out my..." (people ignore)
4. **Wishy-washy takes** - "There are pros and cons to both" (boring)

### Voice Modes That Don't Work:

1. **Corporate speak** - Goes against your authentic voice
2. **Pure positivity** - You're not a cheerleader, you're a builder with opinions
3. **Neutral analysis** - Your personality is your edge, don't hide it

### Structural Issues to Avoid:

1. **Burying the lede** - Hook needs to be first
2. **Summarizing instead of enumerating** - List all, don't generalize
3. **Hedging contrarian takes** - If you're minority, own it
4. **Removing typos in casual mode** - "i an building" stays authentic

---

## RECOMMENDATIONS BASED ON VOICE PROFILE

### DOUBLE DOWN ON:

**1. Lowercase Twitter Posts**

- 60% of your content (dominant mode)
- Highly distinctive (nobody else does this)
- Philosophy + builder updates + product takes
- Keep typos, keep contractions, keep real

**2. Product Comparison Threads**

- Your signature formula
- Outcome-based evaluation (gets it done > quality)
- Real usage data backing claims
- Platform: Twitter threads, LinkedIn posts

**3. Contrarian Technical Takes**

- "everywhere i go...i am in the minority but..."
- Backs with personal usage data
- No hedging
- Platform: Twitter long-form, LinkedIn

**4. Self-Aware Builder Stories**

- "I make mistakes...but I ship"
- Vulnerable + confident balance
- Flow state defense
- Platform: Twitter, LinkedIn

**5. Framework-Heavy Analysis**

- Eras, numbered lists, enumerated comparisons
- Specific data (not vague)
- Analyst mode voice
- Platform: LinkedIn, Twitter threads, Substack

### REDUCE OR STOP:

**1. Generic Inspiration**

- Not your voice
- Oversaturated market
- Zero differentiation

**2. Neutral Product Reviews**

- Boring
- You have opinions, use them
- Take a position

**3. Corporate Tone**

- LinkedIn doesn't require corporate voice
- Your casual Analyst mode works
- Lowercase on LinkedIn? Test it.

- Analyst LinkedIn (daily)
- Product comparisons (2-3x/week)
- Establish baseline metrics

**Week 3-4: Add New Formats**

- Tutorial content (1x/week)
