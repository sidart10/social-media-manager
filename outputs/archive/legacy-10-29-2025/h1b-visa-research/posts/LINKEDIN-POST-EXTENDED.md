## POST (Copy-ready)

Today, Florida banned H-1B hiring at state universities. The policy announcement cited examples like "assistant swim coach from Spain" and "clinical professor from West Bank," asking: "Can't we produce these ourselves?"

Fair question. Wrong solution.

This decision traces back to a viral thread from December 2024 that analyzed 900,000 H-1B records and shaped the immigration debate for months. The thread was methodologically solid, used real data, and got millions of views.

There's just one problem: it analyzed Labor Condition Applications (LCAs), not actual H-1B visas.

**The Core Distinction:**

LCAs are forms employers file with the Department of Labor BEFORE applying for H-1B visas. Think "intent to hire" vs actual hire. It's Step 1 of a 3-step process.

**The Real Pipeline:**
• 900,000 LCAs certified (DOL)
• 400,000 H-1B approvals (USCIS)
• Ratio: 2.25 LCAs per actual approval

Why the gap? Employers file LCAs "just in case," multiple LCAs exist for one position, candidates decline offers, and USCIS denies some petitions.

**Breaking Down the 400,000:**
• NEW employment: 141,000 (35%)
• CONTINUING employment: 259,000 (65%)

Only NEW counts toward the cap. The 259,000 are renewals—same people renewing every 3 years while waiting for green cards.

**The 141,000 New Approvals:**
• Cap-subject: 85,000 (private sector, lottery)
• Cap-exempt: 56,000 (universities, nonprofits, government research)

Here's the irony: DeSantis banned university H-1Bs. But universities are cap-exempt. They don't count toward the 85,000 limit. Banning them doesn't free up a single private sector visa.

**The Misinformation Cascade:**

December 2024: Robert Sterling posts thread analyzing LCA data
→ September 2025: Chamath Palihapitiya cites it on All-In Podcast
→ October 29, 2025: DeSantis announces university ban

No correction about LCA vs USCIS data at any stage.

**The Two-Tier System:**

Sterling WAS right about one thing: the wage problem. But it's not universal—it's concentrated.

Low-wage tier (30-50% of H-1Bs): IT staffing firms like Cognizant, Infosys, TCS. Average: $80k-$92k base, contract workers, 95%+ Indian.

High-wage tier (50-70%): Tech companies like Amazon, Google, Meta. Total comp: $300k-$380k (base + equity), direct employees, 30-50% Indian.

**The India Backlog Crisis:**

Why do renewals dominate? Because 1.1 million Indians face 140-YEAR green card waits. They renew their H-1B 40+ times waiting for permanent residency.

The math: India gets 9,800 green cards/year (7% per-country cap). Demand: 210,000/year. The backlog grows 26 years for every 1 year that passes.

**Evidence-Based Reforms:**

1. Remove per-country caps → Clears Indian backlog in 8-10 years instead of 140
2. Wage-based selection → DHS proposed this in October 2025
3. Separate IT staffing allocation → Different cap for third-party contractors

**Bottom Line:**

We can debate H-1B policy. But let's use the right data. LCA data ≠ H-1B visas. Renewals ≠ new workers. Universities ≠ private sector.

## VISUAL STRATEGY

**Primary Recommendation**: Attach Chart 2 (LCA vs USCIS Funnel)

- File: `images/chart-2-lca-vs-uscis-funnel.png`
- Shows: 900,000 → 400,000 pipeline visually
- Impact: THE core data point everyone missed

**Alternative Option**: Create LinkedIn Carousel (4 slides)

1. **Slide 1**: The Pipeline (900k LCA → 400k approvals → 141k new)
2. **Slide 2**: New vs Renewals (141k vs 259k pie chart)
3. **Slide 3**: Two-Tier System (IT staffing $80k vs tech $300k+)
4. **Slide 4**: India Backlog (140-year wait, 1.1M people)

**Why carousel**: LinkedIn carousels get 3x engagement vs single images

## POSTING STRATEGY

**Optimal Timing**:

- **When**: 24-48 hours AFTER Twitter thread goes live
- **Best days**: Tuesday-Thursday
- **Best time**: 7-9 AM ET (when professionals check LinkedIn)
- **Why delay**: Let Twitter thread gain traction first, then amplify on LinkedIn

**Pre-Post Prep**:

- [ ] Upload visual (Chart 2 or carousel)
- [ ] Have link to Twitter thread ready
- [ ] Prepare USCIS source links for replies
- [ ] Identify 3-5 immigration policy experts to tag (optional)

**First 60 Minutes** (Critical for algorithm):

- Reply to EVERY comment
- Ask follow-up questions to quality comments
- Share additional data points from research brief
- Link to specific charts when explaining complex points
- Engage immigration practitioners and H-1B holders

**Engagement Tactics**:

- Seed discussion: Comment with "The LCA vs USCIS distinction is critical - most media ignores this"
- Prepare for heated debate: Have USCIS official reports ready to cite
- Focus on data-driven discussion: Don't engage bad-faith actors
- Amplify quality responses: Share thoughtful comments

**Cross-Promotion**:

- Mention in post: "I posted a detailed thread on this yesterday"
- Link to Twitter thread: "Full analysis with 9 charts"
- Tease blog post: "Expanding this into 3,500-word analysis with 45+ sources"

## COMMENT RESPONSE TEMPLATES

### If someone says: "You're defending cheap labor!"

**Your response**:
"I explicitly called out the 30-50% low-wage problem with IT staffing firms ($80k-$92k). That's real and needs fixing. The solution: wage-based selection (DHS proposed it). But conflating LCA data with actual visas doesn't help anyone. We need accurate data to design effective policy."

### If someone says: "400k is still too many!"

**Your response**:
"Fair debate to have! But 65% are renewals—same people every 3 years. And 141k new includes 56k cap-exempt (universities). The cap-subject number is 85k, unchanged since 2005 despite tech sector 3x growth. The question is: what's the right number, and why?"

### If someone says: "Indians ARE taking jobs!"

**Your response**:
"Indians face 140-year green card waits. They're not 'flooding in'—they're stuck in legal limbo for generations. The 7% per-country cap means India gets same allocation as Liechtenstein despite 1000x demand. The bottleneck is the backlog system, not the people."

### If immigration lawyer comments positively:

**Your response**:
"Thank you for the validation from a practitioner. I know you've been trying to explain the LCA vs USCIS distinction for years. The data is all public—anyone can verify at USCIS.gov. Appreciate you fact-checking this."

### If H-1B holder shares experience:

**Your response**:
"This is the human side of the data. 12 years waiting, contributing to American innovation, stuck in legal limbo. The 140-year backlog isn't hyperbole—it's USCIS math. Thank you for sharing your story."

## ALTERNATIVE VERSIONS

### Version 2: More Personal Opening (Community Protector Mode)

If you want to add immigrant perspective:

```
Today, Florida banned H-1B hiring at state universities.

As someone who's watched this debate unfold—and received hundreds of messages from people trapped in the 140-year backlog—this hurts.

Because the policy is based on data that's fundamentally wrong.

### Version 3: Shorter Hook (Punchier)

```
A viral thread fooled a billionaire, a podcaster, and a governor.

Today, it became Florida policy.

Here's the data they all missed:
