# PROPER CONTENT GENERATION PLAN - Nov 1-4
**Approach:** Deep thinking, visual concepts, skill-based, quality over speed
**Research:** Using november-content-calendar-research + additional searches
**Skills:** post-writer, deep-web-research, voice-matcher
**Timeline:** Until Monday Nov 4 content is excellent

## WHAT I LEARNED FROM AUDIT

**Visual Thinking Required:**
- LinkedIn posts NEED carousels (278% more engagement)
- Substack newsletters NEED inline images (3x engagement)
- Data comparisons NEED charts (makes abstract concrete)
- Frameworks NEED diagrams (visual > text for understanding)

**Research Depth:**
- I have 6 comprehensive research reports already
- Use them properly (don't skim)
- Fill gaps with deep-web-research skill when needed
- Cite real sources, real data

**Voice Authenticity:**
- Use voice-matcher skill to ensure it sounds like sid
- Reference voice profile (77 posts analyzed)
- Lowercase where appropriate
- No corporate bullshit

2. LinkedIn - PM Mistakes (needs 6-slide carousel with BTD framework visual)
3. Long-form - Anthropic confident (your proven take, minimal changes needed)
4. Substack Note - Haiku underrated (factual, good as-is)
5. Substack Note - H-1B reality (factual, good as-is)
6-7. Twitter Shorts - Philosophy (perfect as-is)

**Saturday Nov 2 (6 pieces):**
1. Thread - Cursor vs Claude (needs token comparison visual)
2. LinkedIn - Craft vs Delivery (needs 5-slide carousel)
3. Long-form - AI separation (good as-is)
4-6. Notes + shorts (good as-is)

**Sunday Nov 3 (3 pieces):**

## VISUAL ASSETS TO CREATE

**Critical (Must Have):**
1. Nov 1 LinkedIn - PM Mistakes carousel (6 slides)
2. Nov 2 LinkedIn - Craft vs Delivery carousel (5 slides)
3. Nov 3 Substack - 5-6 inline images
4. Nov 4 LinkedIn - Strategic Implications carousel (5 slides)

**High Priority:**
5. Nov 2 Thread - Token comparison chart
6. Nov 4 Thread - Agent Builder interface concept

**Total:** 4 carousels + 7-8 individual graphics = ~27-30 images

---

## APPROACH FOR EACH PIECE

1. **Read research** relevant to topic
2. **Search for gaps** in my knowledge
3. **Think visually** - what graphic would help?
4. **Use post-writer template** for structure
5. **Apply voice profile** for authenticity
6. **Fact-check** everything
7. **Create handoff package** for visuals if needed

## STARTING NOW

Let me work through Nov 1-4 properly, one piece at a time, with depth and visual thinking.

This will take time. But it will be right.
