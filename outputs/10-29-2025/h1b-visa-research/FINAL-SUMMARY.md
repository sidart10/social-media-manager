## 💡 KEY INSIGHTS FROM RESEARCH

### The Core Misinformation:
**Robert Sterling analyzed 900k LCA certifications and presented them as H-1B visas**

**Reality**:
- LCA = Labor Condition Application (intent to hire)
- Filed with DOL before USCIS petition
- Multiple LCAs can exist for one position
- Not all LCAs lead to actual H-1B approvals
- Ratio: 2.25 LCAs per 1 USCIS approval

### The Actual Numbers:
- **LCA certifications (DOL)**: ~900,000 positions
- **H-1B approvals (USCIS)**: ~400,000 petitions
  - NEW: 141,000 (35%)
  - RENEWALS: 259,000 (65%)
- **Cap-subject new H-1Bs**: 85,000
- **Cap-exempt new H-1Bs**: 56,000 (universities)

### The India Backlog Crisis:
- **1.1M+ Indians** waiting for green cards
- **EB-2/EB-3 wait**: 140 years (growing 26 years/year)
- **Priority dates**: Stuck at 2013 (12 years behind)
- **Cause**: 7% per-country cap for India = 9,800/year vs 210,000 applicants/year

### The Two-Tier System:
**Low-wage tier** (30-50% of H-1Bs):
- IT staffing firms: Cognizant (93k), Infosys (61k), TCS (60k)
- Salaries: $80k-$92k
- Business model: Contract workers, third-party placement
- Workers: 95%+ Indian

**High-wage tier** (50-70% of H-1Bs):
- Tech companies: Amazon (10k), Microsoft (5k), Meta (5k), Google (4k), Apple (4k)
- Total comp: $300k-$380k (base + equity)
- Business model: Direct employees
- Workers: 30-50% Indian

## 🎓 WHAT WE LEARNED (Process Improvements)

### New Standard: Python + AI Chart Generation
**Problem**: Pure AI charts can get numbers wrong
**Solution**: Python (accurate data) → AI enhancement (visual polish)
**Result**: 100% accurate + professional design
**Cost**: Same as pure AI (~$0.04/chart)
**Time**: +30 seconds per chart (worth it for accuracy)

### Image Organization Rule (Now Permanent)
**Problem**: Images scattered across tool folders
**Solution**: ALL session work in ONE folder under `{session}/images/`
**Updated**: Agent instructions.md + memories.md
**Applies**: All future Jarvis sessions

### Documentation Standard
**New practice**: Create workflow docs for reusable processes
**Example**: `CHART-GENERATION-WORKFLOW.md` for future chart needs
**Benefit**: Don't reinvent the wheel next time
