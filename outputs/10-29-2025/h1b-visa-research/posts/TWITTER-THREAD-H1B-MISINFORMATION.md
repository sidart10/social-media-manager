# Twitter Mega-Thread: H-1B Visa Misinformation Exposed

**Date**: October 29, 2025
**Topic**: H-1B visa data misinformation correction
**Tone**: Firm fact-checker, data-driven, respectful but direct
**Length**: 30 tweets
**Target**: Quote-tweet @RobertMSterling's original thread

---

## TWEET 1 (Opening Hook)
A viral thread about H-1B visas fooled millions of people - including a billionaire who repeated it on the biggest podcast in America.

And today, it led to actual policy.

Here's the data they all missed ðŸ§µ

---

## TWEET 2 (Setup)
On Dec 29, 2024, @RobertMSterling posted a mega-thread analyzing 4M+ H-1B records.

143,000 views. Shaped the entire H-1B debate for months.

There's just one problem: he used the wrong data source.

[CHART 1: Screenshot of Sterling's opening tweet]

---

## TWEET 3 (The Core Issue)
Sterling claimed: "868,000 applications for 85,000 visas"

His analysis was methodologically solid. His conclusions were based on real data.

But he analyzed DOL Labor Condition Applications (LCAs), not actual H-1B visas.

This distinction changes EVERYTHING.

---

## TWEET 4 (Education: What's an LCA?)
What's an LCA?

It's a form employers file with the Dept of Labor BEFORE applying for H-1B with USCIS.

Think of it as "intent to hire" vs actual hire.

It's Step 1 of a 3-step process. Sterling analyzed Step 1 and assumed it was the final outcome.

---

## TWEET 5 (The Data Gap)
Here's the reality:

FY 2019:
â€¢ 968,538 LCAs certified (DOL)
â€¢ 389,323 H-1B approvals (USCIS)

Ratio: 2.5 LCAs per actual approval

FY 2024:
â€¢ ~900,000 LCAs certified
â€¢ ~400,000 H-1B approvals

[CHART 2: LCA vs USCIS Funnel Visualization]

---

## TWEET 6 (Why The Gap?)
Why do 900k LCAs become 400k approvals?

1. Employers file LCAs "just in case" - may not use them
2. Multiple LCAs filed for same position/candidate
3. Candidates decline offers after LCA approval
4. USCIS denies petitions during review
5. LCAs are for POSITIONS, not specific people

---

## TWEET 7 (The 400k Breakdown)
"But wait - 400k approvals is still way more than 85k cap!"

Correct. Here's why:

FY 2024 USCIS approvals:
â€¢ Total: 400,000
â€¢ NEW employment: 141,000 (35%)
â€¢ CONTINUING employment: 259,000 (65%)

Only NEW employment counts toward the cap.

[CHART 3: New vs Renewal Pie Chart]

---

## TWEET 8 (Cap-Exempt Explanation)
Of the 141k NEW approvals:

â€¢ 85,000 = Cap-subject (private sector, lottery)
â€¢ 56,000 = Cap-exempt (universities, nonprofits, gov research)

Universities can hire H-1Bs year-round. They don't compete for the 85k.

This will be important in a minute.

---

## TWEET 9 (The Renewal Reality)
Why are 65% of H-1B approvals renewals?

Because the same people renew every 3 years while waiting for green cards.

Indians face 140-YEAR green card waits. They must renew their H-1B 40+ times.

Same person â‰  40 new workers.

---

## TWEET 10 (The Misinformation Cascade)
So Sterling's analysis went viral with incorrect framing.

Then the amplification began:

Sep 2025: @chamath references the thread on All-In Podcast (episode: "H-1B Shakeup")

No correction about LCA vs USCIS data.

The misinformation spreads to 100k+ listeners.

---

## TWEET 11 (DeSantis Breaking News)
Today - Oct 29, 2025 (literally hours ago):

Ron DeSantis announces Florida will BAN H-1B hiring at state universities.

His reasoning: "We can do it with our residents in Florida or with Americans."

The misinformation has become policy.

[CHART 4: Screenshot of DeSantis announcement]

---

## TWEET 12 (The DeSantis Irony)
Here's the problem with DeSantis's ban:

Universities are CAP-EXEMPT.

They don't count toward the 85,000 visa limit. They exist in a separate allocation pool.

Banning university H-1Bs doesn't free up a SINGLE visa for private sector Americans.

---

## TWEET 13 (DeSantis Examples)
DeSantis cited examples of university H-1B hires:
â€¢ "Public policy professor from China"
â€¢ "Assistant swim coach from Spain"
â€¢ "Clinical professor from West Bank"

His question: "Can't we produce these ourselves?"

Fair question. Wrong solution.

---

## TWEET 14 (University Reality)
Universities hire ~56,000 H-1Bs/year (cap-exempt).

Many are their OWN F-1 graduates who studied in US for 4-6 years.

Example: International PhD student
â†’ Graduates from UF
â†’ Becomes assistant professor at UF
â†’ Now banned under DeSantis policy?

The system is eating itself.

---

## TWEET 15 (Transition to Funnels)
Let me show you the ACTUAL funnels.

Not the scary numbers. Not the inflated LCA data.

The real pipeline from university to H-1B to green card.

These are the charts the misinformation campaign doesn't want you to see:

---

## TWEET 16 (Funnel 1: F-1 to H-1B)
FUNNEL 1: University â†’ H-1B

â€¢ 1.1M F-1 international students in USA
â€¢ 250k graduate annually
â€¢ 30k convert to H-1B (12% success rate)
â€¢ 442k total applicants compete for 85k cap spots
â€¢ ~25% selection rate in 2025 lottery

Only 1 in 4 applicants wins the lottery.

[CHART 5: F-1 to H-1B Funnel]

---

## TWEET 17 (Funnel 1 Context)
Of those 30k F-1â†’H-1B conversions:

â€¢ 69% have Master's degrees from US universities
â€¢ 14% have PhDs from US universities
â€¢ 15% have Bachelor's only

Median salary: $79,000 (2017 data)

These aren't "cheap labor." These are US-educated professionals.

---

## TWEET 18 (Funnel 2: The Complete H-1B Pipeline)
FUNNEL 2: The Complete H-1B Breakdown

DOL LCAs Certified: ~900,000 positions
â†“ (filtering)
USCIS Approvals: ~400,000 total
â”œâ”€ NEW: 141,000 (35%)
â”‚  â”œâ”€ Cap-subject: 85,000
â”‚  â””â”€ Cap-exempt: 56,000
â””â”€ RENEWALS: 259,000 (65%)

[CHART 6: Complete LCA to Approval Funnel]

---

## TWEET 19 (Funnel 3: India Backlog)
FUNNEL 3: The Green Card Backlog Crisis

After getting H-1B, workers apply for permanent residency (green cards).

For Indians, this is where everything breaks:

1.1 MILLION Indians waiting
EB-2/EB-3: 140-year wait times
Priority dates stuck at 2013

[CHART 7: India Backlog Funnel]

---

## TWEET 20 (Backlog Math)
The math is brutal:

India green card allocation: ~9,800/year (7% of 140k cap)
Indian applicants: ~210,000/year

Gap: 21x demand vs supply

Result: Backlog grows 26 YEARS for every 1 year that passes.

This isn't a queue. It's a generational trap.

---

## TWEET 21 (The 7% Cap Absurdity)
The 7% per-country cap means:

India (population 1.4 billion, 75% of H-1B demand):
â†’ 9,800 green cards/year

Liechtenstein (population 40,000, 0% of demand):
â†’ 9,800 green cards/year (never used)

This system was designed in 1990. It's broken.

---

## TWEET 22 (The Two-Tier System - Setup)
Sterling WAS right about something important: the two-tier wage system.

But it's not "all H-1Bs suppress wages."

It's: 30-50% of H-1Bs are in a problematic low-wage tier.

Let me show you the split:

---

## TWEET 23 (Low-Wage Tier)
LOW-WAGE TIER: IT Staffing Firms

â€¢ Cognizant: 93,000 LCAs (5-year total)
â€¢ Infosys: 61,000
â€¢ TCS: 60,000
â€¢ Wipro: 40,000

Average salary: $80k-$100k
Workers: 95%+ Indian
Model: Contract workers placed at client sites

[CHART 8: IT Staffing Firms Bar Chart]

---

## TWEET 24 (High-Wage Tier)
HIGH-WAGE TIER: Tech Companies

â€¢ Amazon: 10,044 approvals (FY25)
â€¢ Microsoft: 5,189
â€¢ Meta: 5,123
â€¢ Google: 4,181

Average BASE: $150k-$200k
Total comp: $250k-$350k (with equity)
Workers: 30-50% Indian

[CHART 9: Tech Companies Bar Chart]

---

## TWEET 25 (The Wage Comparison)
Sterling's data showed BASE salary only.

Tech companies pay massive equity/bonuses:

Google L5 Software Engineer:
â€¢ Base: $180,000 (what H-1B data shows)
â€¢ Total: $350,000+ (actual compensation)

IT staffing firms:
â€¢ Base: $85,000 (what H-1B data shows)
â€¢ Total: $85,000 (no equity)

---

## TWEET 26 (The Business Model Difference)
The business models are completely different:

IT STAFFING:
1. Hire workers in India
2. Bring to US on H-1B
3. Place as contractors at clients
4. Bill $100/hr, pay worker $40/hr
5. Pocket $60/hr arbitrage

TECH COMPANIES:
1. Hire directly
2. Full-time employees
3. Career growth, equity, benefits

---

## TWEET 27 (The Shift That's Happening)
And here's what's actually changing:

Indian IT firms (2016-2024): -56% H-1B usage
â€¢ Cognizant, TCS, Infosys reducing H-1B dependence

American tech giants (2016-2024): +189% H-1B usage
â€¢ Amazon +478%, Meta +244%, Google +137%

The market is self-correcting.

---

## TWEET 28 (The Real Problems)
The REAL issues that need fixing:

1. âœ— LCA data presented as visa data
2. âœ— Per-country 7% cap (designed 1990)
3. âœ— 140-year wait = legal limbo for Indians
4. âœ— IT staffing and tech using same program
5. âœ— No wage-based selection (yet)

These are solvable problems.

---

## TWEET 29 (The Solutions)
Evidence-based reforms:

1. Remove per-country caps â†’ Would clear Indian backlog in 8-10 years instead of 140

2. Wage-based selection â†’ DHS already proposed this (Oct 2025). Higher wages = higher lottery odds.

3. Separate IT staffing allocation â†’ Different cap for third-party contractors

---

## TWEET 30 (The Bottom Line)
Bottom line:

LCA data â‰  H-1B visa data
Renewals â‰  new workers
Universities â‰  private sector (cap-exempt!)
India backlog â‰  invasion (it's systemic failure)

We can debate H-1B policy. But let's use the RIGHT data.

## TWEET 31 (Bonus: The Sources)
Sources for this thread:

â€¢ USCIS Official Reports (FY 2024)
â€¢ Pew Research H-1B Analysis (March 2025)
â€¢ Debarghya Das backlog calculations
â€¢ Robert Sterling's original thread (for comparison)
â€¢ DeSantis announcement (Oct 29, 2025)

All data is public. All sources are linked in the blog post.

---

## OPTIONAL TWEET 32 (Personal Note)
Why does this matter to me?

Because bad data leads to bad policy.

DeSantis just banned university H-1Bs based on a misunderstanding of what "cap-exempt" means.

Sterling analyzed real data but drew wrong conclusions.

We can do better. We MUST do better.

## EXPECTED REACTIONS & RESPONSES

### Likely Pushback 1: "You're defending cheap labor!"
**Your Response**:
"I'm defending accurate data. The thread explicitly shows the 30-50% low-wage problem with IT staffing firms. Reform needed: wage-based selection to fix that tier. But conflating LCA data with actual visas helps nobody."

### Likely Pushback 2: "400k is still too many!"
**Your Response**:
"Fair debate to have! But 65% are renewals (same people every 3 years). And 141k new includes 56k cap-exempt (universities). The cap-subject number is 85k - unchanged since 2005 despite tech sector 3x growth."

### Likely Pushback 3: "Indians ARE taking jobs!"
**Your Response**:
"Indians face 140-year green card waits. They're not 'flooding in' - they're stuck in legal limbo for generations. The 7% per-country cap is the bottleneck. India gets same allocation as Liechtenstein despite 1000x demand."

### Likely Support: Immigration Lawyers
**Your Amplification**:
"Yes! Thank you for pointing this out. I've been trying to explain LCA vs USCIS difference for years. This thread is the clearest explanation I've seen."
â†’ Retweet and add: "Appreciate immigration practitioners fact-checking this research. The data is all public - anyone can verify."

### Likely Support: Tech Workers
**Your Amplification**:
"As someone on H-1B waiting 12 years for green card, THANK YOU for explaining the backlog. Most Americans have no idea we're stuck."
â†’ Retweet with: "This is the human side of the data. Legal limbo for decades while contributing to American innovation."

## VIRAL OPTIMIZATION CHECKLIST

### Elements That Increase Viral Probability:

âœ… **Correction narrative** - "Everyone got this wrong, here's truth"
âœ… **Timely hook** - DeSantis announcement TODAY (Oct 29)
âœ… **Authority signal** - Citing official USCIS data, not opinions
âœ… **Visual data** - 10 charts make it shareable
âœ… **Clear villain** - Misinformation (not attacking people)
âœ… **Respectful callout** - "Honest mistake" framing for Sterling
âœ… **Actionable ending** - Reform proposals, not just criticism
âœ… **Thread length** - 30-32 tweets hits sweet spot for depth
âœ… **Quote-tweet strategy** - Engages with original source
âœ… **Data > opinions** - Pure facts, minimal commentary

### Engagement Hooks:

- **Tweet 1**: Curiosity gap (what did they miss?)
- **Tweet 11**: Breaking news (DeSantis today!)
- **Tweet 19**: Shocking number (140-year wait)
- **Tweet 21**: Absurdist comparison (India = Liechtenstein allocation)
- **Tweet 24**: Tech company defense (will trigger debate)

---

## RISK MITIGATION

### Potential Controversies:

**Risk 1**: Sterling or his supporters attack your analysis
**Mitigation**: Every claim backed by USCIS official source. Include source links in blog post. Tone is "he used wrong data source" not "he's dumb."

**Risk 2**: Right-wing accounts accuse you of being "pro-cheap labor"
**Mitigation**: Thread explicitly calls out IT staffing low-wage tier (30-50% problem). Proposes wage-based selection as solution.

**Risk 3**: Left-wing accounts accuse you of "defending corporate exploitation"
**Mitigation**: Show India backlog as humanitarian crisis. Frame as systemic failure needing reform, not defense of status quo.

**Risk 4**: Getting ratio'd for being "too technical"
**Mitigation**: Lead with emotion (DeSantis policy TODAY), follow with data. Use visuals heavily. Explain concepts simply.
