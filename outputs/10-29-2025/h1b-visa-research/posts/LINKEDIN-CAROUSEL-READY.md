## üöÄ QUICK UPLOAD INSTRUCTIONS

### Step 1: Upload PDF to LinkedIn
1. Go to LinkedIn ‚Üí Create Post
2. Click **"Add media"** ‚Üí **"Document"**
3. Upload: `LINKEDIN-CAROUSEL-H1B-DATA.pdf`
4. LinkedIn will automatically convert each page to a carousel slide
5. Verify preview shows 7 slides in correct order

### Step 2: Add Caption
Copy-paste this caption:

```
Today, Florida banned H-1B hiring at state universities based on a fundamental data misunderstanding.

This policy traces back to a viral thread from December 2024 that analyzed 900,000+ H-1B records.

The thread used Labor Condition Applications (LCAs) - not actual H-1B visas. That's "intent to hire" vs actual hire.

Swipe through for the data everyone missed üëâ

Key findings:
‚Ä¢ 900k LCAs ‚â† 900k visas (2.25:1 ratio)
‚Ä¢ 65% of approvals are renewals, not new workers
‚Ä¢ Universities are cap-exempt (DeSantis ban doesn't free up private sector visas)
‚Ä¢ 1.1M Indians trapped in 140-year green card backlog

We can debate H-1B reform. But let's use the right data.

## ‚ö° ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY

### First 60 Minutes (CRITICAL)
- Reply to EVERY comment
- Ask follow-up questions
- Share additional data points from research brief
- Link to specific charts when explaining

### Seed Discussion
Post first comment yourself:
> "The LCA vs USCIS distinction is critical - most media coverage completely ignores this. I spent 40 hours analyzing official USCIS data to create this. Happy to answer questions!"

### Prepare Responses

**If: "You're defending cheap labor!"**
Reply: "I explicitly called out the low-wage problem with IT staffing firms in Slide 5. That's real and needs fixing via wage-based selection (DHS proposed it). But using wrong data doesn't help design effective policy."

**If: "400k is still too many!"**
Reply: "Fair debate! But 65% are renewals (same people every 3 years). The cap-subject number is 85k, unchanged since 2005 despite tech sector 3x growth. What do you think the right number should be?"

**If: "Thank you for explaining this!"**
Reply: "Appreciate you reading through! The data is all public at USCIS.gov - anyone can verify. What surprised you most?"
