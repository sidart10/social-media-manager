**File**: `images/chart-2-lca-vs-uscis-funnel.png`

**Key numbers shown**:
- 900,000 LCAs certified (DOL)
- 400,000 H-1B approvals (USCIS)

**File**: `images/chart-3-new-vs-renewal-pie.png`

**Caption for LinkedIn post**:

**Option B - Show Both (Recommended)**:
Create a combined slide or use both files as two separate slides (making it 8 slides total)

**Purpose**: Acknowledge the legitimate wage concern Sterling raised

---

### Slide 6: The India Backlog Crisis
**File**: `images/chart-7-india-backlog.png`

**Caption for LinkedIn post**:
"Why do renewals dominate? Because 1.1 million Indians face 140-YEAR green card waits. The backlog grows 26 years for every 1 year that passes. This isn't a queue - it's a generational trap."

**Purpose**: Explain the human cost and systemic failure

**Key numbers**:
- 1.1M Indians waiting

## LinkedIn Post Caption (To Accompany Carousel)

```
Today, Florida banned H-1B hiring at state universities based on a fundamental data misunderstanding.

This policy traces back to a viral thread from December 2024 that analyzed 900,000+ H-1B records.

The thread used Labor Condition Applications (LCAs) - not actual H-1B visas. That's "intent to hire" vs actual hire.

Swipe through for the data everyone missed ðŸ‘‰

Key findings:
â€¢ 900k LCAs â‰  900k visas (2.25:1 ratio)
â€¢ 65% of approvals are renewals, not new workers
â€¢ Universities are cap-exempt (DeSantis ban doesn't free up private sector visas)
â€¢ 1.1M Indians trapped in 140-year green card backlog

We can debate H-1B reform. But let's use the right data.
