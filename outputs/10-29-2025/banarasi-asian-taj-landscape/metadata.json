She wears a luxurious navy blue Banarasi saree with intricate gold zari brocade featuring ornate floral and paisley motifs. Traditional Indian jewelry including jhumka earrings and bangles. Her hair is styled in an elegant bun. Behind her, the magnificent white marble Taj Mahal with its iconic dome and four minarets rises majestically against a clear blue sky. The famous Mughal gardens with symmetrical reflecting pools lead up to the monument. Golden hour lighting creates warm, soft illumination. The model's East Asian features are clear and photorealistic. Professional editorial photography with excellent depth of field - sharp focus on the model while the Taj Mahal provides stunning context in the background. The composition creates a beautiful cultural fusion between East Asian beauty and Indian heritage. Shot with the quality of high-end travel and fashion photography.",
