## SUBJECT LINE

The agent platform decision that will define your next 3 years

---

## NEWSLETTER

OpenAI and Anthropic both launched agent platforms in October.

Within days of each other. AgentKit on October 6. Claude Agent SDK on September 29.

This timing isn't coincidence. It's a calculated race for the enterprise AI stack.

And the platform you choose now will define your product architecture for the next 3 years. Maybe longer.

Here's what you need to know.

## What These Platforms Actually Do

Let's be precise about what we're comparing.

**AgentKit** isn't a chatbot builder. It's a complete development environment for building autonomous agents that perform multi-step tasks without constant supervision.

Four components:

**Agent Builder:** Visual canvas. You drag nodes (agent tasks, if/else logic, user approvals, guardrails), connect them with typed edges, configure everything visually. Sam Altman described it as "Canva for building agents."

**ChatKit:** Embeddable interfaces. Drop a ChatGPT-powered assistant into your app. Custom prompts, custom workflows, your branding.

**Evals:** Performance measurement. Here's what most people miss - you can test your AgentKit workflows against Claude, Gemini, ANY model. Not just GPT-5. OpenAI acknowledging model choice matters is strategically significant.

**Connector Registry:** Pre-built, secured integrations. Google Drive, Dropbox, Teams, Salesforce. Enterprise-ready data connections.

The demo that sold everyone: Christina Huang (OpenAI engineer) built a complete travel booking agent onstage. Eight minutes. Live. Calendar integration, preference handling, autonomous booking. Functional agent in 8 minutes.

**Claude Agent SDK** takes the opposite approach.

No visual builder. Code-first. The philosophy: "Give Claude a computer, let it work like humans do."

What this means in practice:

The SDK gives Claude access to your terminal. It can:
• Run bash commands
• Read and edit files
• Execute code
• Integrate tools via MCP (Model Context Protocol)
• Self-host everything on YOUR infrastructure

At Anthropic, this SDK now powers "almost all major agent loops" according to their engineering blog. They use it for research, video creation, note-taking - applications far beyond coding.

The architecture: You run MCP tool servers. Claude calls them. You control what Claude can access, where data lives, how it's processed.

Everything is code. Everything is self-hosted. Everything is under your control.

## The Enterprise Results (What's Actually Shipping)

The data from real companies using these platforms:

**AgentKit:**
• Ramp cut agent development from 6 months to 6 weeks (75% reduction)
• Carlyle reported 50% faster development, 30% better agent accuracy
• LY Corporation built multi-agent workflow in under 2 hours

These aren't aspirational. These are production agents handling real business processes at real companies.

**Claude SDK:**
The metrics are less public (Anthropic doesn't market like OpenAI), but the usage signal is clear: Anthropic runs their own company on it. Research infrastructure, content creation, internal tooling - all powered by the SDK they're selling to you.

When a company eats its own dog food at that scale, pay attention.

## The Strategic Difference Nobody's Explaining

Here's where it gets interesting.

AgentKit is centralized. You build on OpenAI's canvas, use their connectors, run on their runtime. Everything managed.

The benefit: Christina's 8-minute demo. Ramp's 6-month → 6-week transformation. You ship incredibly fast.

The risk: A developer on X (@Consciogen) called it perfectly:

"You're not building. You're renting. OpenAI controls your runtime, your models, your connectors."

What happens if:
• OpenAI raises prices 5x? (They control pricing)
• A connector you depend on breaks? (You wait for OpenAI to fix)
• You need data locality for compliance? (Can't, it runs on their infrastructure)
• You want to switch models? (Entire agent workflow tied to GPT-5)

Claude SDK is decentralized. You run the code. On your servers. With your MCP tool integrations.

The benefit: Zero lock-in. Want to swap from Claude to GPT to Gemini? Change one line of code. Need data in your VPC for compliance? It's already there. Pricing increases? Negotiate or switch providers.

The cost: More engineering work upfront. You maintain the servers. You write the code. You handle the infrastructure.

This is the cloud platform decision all over again.

AWS made it easy. But you're locked in. Running your own data center gives you control. But it's more work.

Same tradeoff. New context.

## The MCP Wild Card (Why This Matters More Than You Think)

Claude SDK uses Model Context Protocol (MCP). Open standard. Anyone can build MCP servers. The ecosystem is already growing - developers are shipping MCP integrations for databases, APIs, file systems, everything.

AgentKit uses Connector Registry. Proprietary. OpenAI-controlled. If you need a connector that doesn't exist, you wait for OpenAI to build it.

If MCP becomes the standard (and Anthropic is betting heavily on this), Claude SDK's open approach creates a compounding advantage. More developers building MCP tools = more capabilities for Claude agents = stronger ecosystem.

If it doesn't, AgentKit's curated, managed connectors win on "just works" reliability.

This is the standards war underneath the platform war.

## What You Should Actually Do

If you're building AI agents right now, here's the framework:

**Week 1: Validate Fast**
Build in AgentKit. Use Agent Builder's visual canvas. Prove the concept works. Get stakeholder buy-in.

Time investment: Hours, not weeks.

**Week 2-4: Evaluate Lock-In**
Ask yourself:
• Do we need data locality for compliance?
• Will we want model flexibility later?
• Can we afford platform dependency?
• Do we have engineering resources for self-hosting?

Be honest. These answers determine your path.

**Month 2: Make the Call**

If lock-in risks are acceptable: Stay on AgentKit. Ship fast. Iterate quickly.

If lock-in risks matter: Migrate to Claude SDK now (while agent is simple). The earlier you migrate, the less it costs.

If you're unsure: Run both in parallel. AgentKit for speed, Claude SDK for learning. De-risk with optionality.

**The Teams Getting This Right:**

They're not asking "which is better." They're asking "which tradeoff matches our risk profile."

Startups optimizing for speed: AgentKit
Enterprises needing control: Claude SDK
Smart teams with resources: Both

**My Honest Take:**

I'd prototype in AgentKit. The 8-minute demo isn't marketing - the visual builder genuinely accelerates validation.

But I'd plan the Claude SDK migration from day one. Because platform lock-in compounds. And switching costs only increase.

Optionality costs less than betting wrong.

The agent platform you choose now determines your architecture for years. Choose based on your 3-year trajectory, not your current sprint.
