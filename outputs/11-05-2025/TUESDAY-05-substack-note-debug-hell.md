## NOTE (Copy-Ready)

spent 30 minutes debugging an agentkit context window error this morning.

the abstraction that makes it fast to build also makes it opaque when it breaks.

tradeoffs everywhere.

claude sdk? errors are explicit. you own the code, you fix it.

agentkit? visual builder hides the internals. debugging = guessing.

still worth it for prototypes. but production? different story.
