## THREAD (Copy-Ready)

**Tweet 1/7** (HOOK):
built the same agent on both platforms. one was easier. the other was better. here's the breakdown üßµ

---

**Tweet 2/7** (SETUP):
AgentKit (OpenAI, Oct 6):
‚Ä¢ Visual builder, drag-drop nodes
‚Ä¢ Managed runtime (they host it)
‚Ä¢ Built agent in 45 min

Claude SDK (Anthropic, Sep 29):
‚Ä¢ Code-first approach
‚Ä¢ Self-hosted (you run it)
‚Ä¢ Built agent in 2 hours

---

**Tweet 3/7** (SPEED VS CONTROL):
AgentKit wins on speed.

Setup: 2 min (npm + API key).
First agent: 45 min with visual builder.
No server config needed.

Ramp did this in "a couple of hours" vs their previous "months."

---

**Tweet 4/7** (THE TRADEOFF):
Claude SDK wins on control.

Full bash access, custom MCP servers, self-hosted.
Powers "almost all major agent loops" at Anthropic.

But setup took me 2 hours (server config, MCP setup, testing).

---

**Tweet 5/7** (THE PROBLEM):
AgentKit's abstraction is also its weakness.

Spent 30 min debugging context window error. Visual builder = fast iteration but opaque failures.

Claude SDK: Error traces are explicit. You own the code, you fix it.

---

**Tweet 6/7** (USE CASE MAPPING):
When to use which:

AgentKit:
‚Üí Prototypes, demos, validation
‚Üí Non-technical teams
‚Üí Fast iteration

Claude SDK:
‚Üí Production deployments
‚Üí Custom integrations
‚Üí Compliance requirements (you host the data)

---

**Tweet 7/7** (VERDICT + CTA):
verdict: agentkit moves faster, claude sdk thinks deeper. pick based on your stage.

validating idea? agentkit. scaling to production? claude sdk.

2. Like every reply
3. Engage with comments asking questions

**24-Hour Plan**:
- Quote tweet with additional technical insight
- Link to Monday's AgentKit thread
