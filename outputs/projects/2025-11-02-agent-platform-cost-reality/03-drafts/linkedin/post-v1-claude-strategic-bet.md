## POST (Copy-Ready)

Claude SDK costs 15x more than Gemini. I'm using it anyway.

Here's why price isn't the only variable:

**The cost comparison (per agent task):**
• Gemini Flash: $0.00008
• Claude Sonnet: $0.0012 (15x more)
• OpenAI GPT-5: $0.0015

Google wins on price. Nobody disputes this.

**But OpenAI's strategy is fragmented:**

They shipped three agent frameworks in 12 months:
• Swarm (Oct 2024): "Educational only, don't use in production"
• Agents SDK (Mar 2025): Production-ready, but OpenAI-locked
• AgentKit (Oct 2025): Managed platform

Three products. No clear path.

**Anthropic shipped one answer:**

Claude SDK (Sep 2025):
✓ Self-hosted (you control deployment)
✓ MCP open standard (200+ community servers)
✓ Production-ready from day 1

**The strategic difference:**

OpenAI launches feel reactive. Swarm deprecated for Agents SDK. Agents SDK shadowed by AgentKit.

Anthropic launches feed forward. Claude Code → MCP → Agent SDK → Skills. Each builds on the last.

**The ecosystem bet:**

Every application will embed agents. Not as standalone products, but as integrated features.

That requires self-hosting, customization, and zero platform lock-in.

Claude SDK delivers. AgentKit doesn't.

**What Claude's 15x premium buys:**
• Real control (not managed dependency)
• Open standards (MCP, not proprietary)
• Ecosystem velocity (community, not vendor-only)

OpenAI has three products trying to be one answer.
Anthropic has one answer.

I'm paying the premium.

## POSTING STRATEGY

**Best Time**:

- Tuesday-Thursday, 8-9 AM EST (professional audience peak)
- Alternative: 12-1 PM EST (lunch scroll)

**Engagement Plan (First 60 Minutes)**:

1. Reply to every comment with technical insights
2. Share additional data in replies (caching savings, batch API)
3. Answer questions about MCP protocol
4. Engage with senior engineers and architects
5. Don't just "thanks for sharing" - add value in every reply

**Comment Starters to Seed Discussion**:

1. "I'm curious: how many people even know OpenAI released Swarm and then told us not to use it?"
2. "The MCP ecosystem went from 0 to 200+ servers in 6 months. That's network effects in action."
3. "Managed platforms are convenient until you hit compliance requirements. Then self-hosted is the only path."

**Reply Strategy**:

- Technical questions → Detailed answers (showcase expertise)
- Disagreement → Data-backed reasoning (not defensive)
- Agreement → Ask their experience (build discussion)
- Platform debates → Share research sources (credibility)

## HASHTAG STRATEGY

**Selected Hashtags** (5):

1. #AI - Broad reach (tech industry)
2. #Agents - Niche targeted (agent developers)
3. #TechnicalLeadership - Professional audience
4. #ProductStrategy - Decision-makers
5. #OpenSource - Ecosystem focus

**Mix**: 2 broad (AI, TechnicalLeadership) + 3 niche (Agents, ProductStrategy, OpenSource)

**Why these**:

- #AI: 30M+ followers (broad visibility)
- #Agents: Growing community (agent builders)
- #TechnicalLeadership: Your audience (senior eng, architects)
- #ProductStrategy: Decision-makers evaluating platforms
- #OpenSource: MCP ecosystem relevance

---

## TAGGING STRATEGY (Optional)

**Consider tagging** (IF they're in your network):

- Engineering leaders at companies using Claude SDK
- People who've written about MCP
- Technical influencers discussing agent platforms

**Don't tag**:

- OpenAI employees (confrontational)
- People you don't know well (spam)
- More than 3 people total (looks desperate)

**Recommendation**: Skip tagging on first post. Let content stand alone. Tag in follow-up comments if relevant people engage.
