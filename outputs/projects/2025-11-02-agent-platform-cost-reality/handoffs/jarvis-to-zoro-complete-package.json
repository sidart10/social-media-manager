Claude wins on clarity.\n\nOpenAI's confusion:\n• Swarm (Oct 2024): \"Educational only, don't use in production\"\n• Agents SDK (Mar 2025): Production Swarm, still OpenAI-locked\n• AgentKit (Oct 2025): Managed platform\n\nThree products.

Swarm deprecated for Agents SDK. Agents SDK shadowed by AgentKit. Throwing products at the wall.\n\nAnthropic launches feed forward. Claude Code → MCP → Agent SDK → Skills. Each builds on the last. Clear roadmap execution.\n\nThe ecosystem bet:\n\nEvery app will embed agents. Not as standalone products. As integrated features.\n\nThat requires self-hosting, customization, zero lock-in.\n\nClaude SDK delivers.\nAgentKit doesn't.\n\nclaude's 15x premium buys:\n• real control (not managed dependency)\n• open standards (mcp, not proprietary)\n• ecosystem velocity (community, not vendor-only)\n\nopenai has three answers. anthropic has one. i'm paying the premium.",

        "text": "OpenAI shipped three agent runtimes in 12 months. Anthropic shipped one.\n\nThe architectural divergence determines who wins.\n\n**OpenAI's three products:**\n\n• Swarm (Oct 2024): Stateless client-side loop. README says \"educational framework... not intended for production.\" 20.6K GitHub stars, explicitly NOT for real apps.\n\n• Agents SDK (Mar 2025): Production-ready upgrade of Swarm. But docs say \"designed to work primarily with OpenAI's models.\" Open source code ≠ open ecosystem. Still locked to OpenAI infrastructure.\n\n• AgentKit (Oct 2025): Managed platform. Visual builder, connector registry, OpenAI hosts your runtime. Convenient until you need custom tools, data residency, or compliance controls.\n\nThree products in 12 months. No clear path.\n\n**Anthropic's one answer:**\n\nClaude SDK (Sep 29, 2025):\n✓ Self-hosted agent runtime (you control deployment)\n✓ MCP protocol (JSON-RPC 2.0 open standard)\n✓ 200+ community MCP servers (vs proprietary registry)\n✓ Production-ready from day 1 (no educational disclaimers)\n\nBuilt on the same harness that powers Claude Code.\n\n**The technical difference:**\n\nState management:\n• AgentKit: Managed state (unknown serialization, backup, topology)\n• Claude SDK: Your infrastructure (Redis, RDS, S3 - your choice)\n\nTool execution:\n• AgentKit: Network hops × 2 (200-800ms latency, black box)\n• Claude SDK: In-process (10-50ms, full control)\n\nDeployment:\n• AgentKit: OpenAI regions only\n• Claude SDK: AWS, GCP, on-prem, anywhere (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2 = your architecture)\n\n**The strategic pattern:**\n\nOpenAI: Swarm (deprecated) → Agents SDK → AgentKit\nPattern: Reactive. Fragmented. Overlapping products.\n\nAnthropic: Claude Code → MCP → Agent SDK → Skills\nPattern: Feed-forward. Each launch builds on the last.\n\nOne company has a roadmap. The other is experimenting in public.\n\n**The ecosystem bet:**\n\nEvery application will embed agents. Not as standalone products, but as integrated features.\n\nThat requires self-hosting, customization, and zero platform lock-in.\n\nMCP open standard: Build tools once, works everywhere. 200+ community servers in 6 months. Community velocity > vendor gatekeeping.\n\nAgentKit's proprietary registry: Curated by OpenAI. Request new connectors. Wait for approval.\n\n**Why I'm betting on Claude SDK:**\n\nNot because it's cheaper (it's not).\nNot because it's easier (AgentKit's visual builder wins on speed).\n\nBecause architecture matters more than price in the long game.\n\nStandards win. Proprietary systems fragment.\nSelf-hosted scales. Managed platforms hit ceilings.\nCommunity velocity > vendor control.\n\nI'm paying the premium.\n\n---\n\nFollow me for technical deep-dives on AI infrastructure, agent architectures, and platform engineering.\n\nWhat's your agent platform choice? And what architectural factors matter most to your decision?\n\n#AIAgents #TechnicalArchitecture #CloudInfrastructure #EngineeringLeadership #OpenSource",
