## What We Built

### 1. Comprehensive Research Brief

**File:** `01-research/research-brief.md`
**Length:** 16 sections, ~8000 words

## Recommendations

**My take:** Publish the Twitter thread today. The content is strong, voice is authentic, data is solid.

**Add screenshot to Tweet 4** (03-progressive-disclosure.png) - shows the 3-tier architecture visually.

**Post LinkedIn tomorrow** - gives thread 24 hours to gather discussion, which you can reference.

**Request carousel from Zoe** (optional) - The comparison table would look great as a dark LinkedIn carousel. Takes your static post and makes it viral-format.

---

**Want me to help with:**

1. Creating the Zoe handoff package for carousel?
2. Generating more content (YouTube script, builder story, Substack)?
3. Reviewing the posts one more time before you publish?

**Or you good to go?** Everything's ready!
