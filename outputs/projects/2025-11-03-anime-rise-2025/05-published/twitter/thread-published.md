Demon Slayer cost $20M to make. Brad Pitt's F1 cost $250M.

Both grossed ~$650M at the box office.

One has 33x ROI. One has 2.5x ROI.

Here's why anime is taking over 🧵

The numbers are wild.

2025 worldwide box office top 10:
• Ne Zha 2 (anime): $1.9B
• Demon Slayer (anime): $670M

Both beat Superman, Mission: Impossible, and every superhero film released this year.

**Tweet 3/10:**
Sony's highest-grossing film of 2025? Demon Slayer.

It accounts for 20% of their entire US box office.

When you don't have Spider-Man or Jumanji, a single anime film becomes your lifeline.

**Tweet 4/10:**
The budget comparison reveals something deeper.

Average anime film: $20-30M
Average Hollywood blockbuster: $150-250M

But this isn't just about cost efficiency. It's about what each industry is willing to make.

**Tweet 5/10:**
Demon Slayer: brutal demon violence wrapped around themes of grief and resilience.

Chainsaw Man: absurd, hyper-violent chaos with commentary on manipulation.

Attack on Titan: genocide with moral questions about freedom.

All rated for teens. All have depth.

**Tweet 6/10:**
Hollywood got focus-grouped into submission.

The MCU made 37 films with basically the same formula. Sanitized violence. Quippy dialogue. Safe storytelling that won't offend anyone.

Result? Box office dropped 50% from 2019 peak.

**Tweet 7/10:**
Anime kept the wildness.

Stories that go too far. Vulgarity mixed with meaning. Controversial themes that still teach something valuable.

Gen Z isn't choosing anime because it's accessible. They're choosing it because it takes risks.

**Tweet 8/10:**
Every Westernized anime adaptation failed:

Dragonball Evolution: sanitized for Western audience → bomb
Death Note (Netflix): stripped of edge → bomb
Cowboy Bebop (Netflix): focus-grouped → canceled

When you remove what made it special, nothing remains.

**Tweet 9/10:**
The data on Gen Z is striking.

50% watch anime weekly (vs 25% who watch the NFL).
59% of teens identify as anime fans.
75% use it to decompress when stressed.

This is emotional connection, not just entertainment.

**Tweet 10/10:**
Hollywood's decline isn't about superhero fatigue or streaming disruption.

It's cultural. An acceptance of safe, sanitized storytelling.

Anime stayed willing to be weird, violent, and meaningful. That's why it's winning with the next generation.
