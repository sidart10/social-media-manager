## THREAD (Copy-Ready)

**Tweet 1/9** (HOOK):
demon slayer cost $20M. brad pitt's F1 cost $250M.

both made ~$650M at box office.

one has 33x ROI. one has 2.5x.

this is what disruption actually looks like 🧵

---

**Tweet 2/9**:
hollywood thinks you need $200M+ to compete. stars. VFX. marketing blitz. that's the playbook.

anime said: what if we don't play that game at all?

---

**Tweet 3/9**:
2025 box office top 10:

• Ne Zha 2 (anime): $1.9B
• Demon Slayer (anime): $670M

both beat Superman. both beat Mission: Impossible. beat every superhero film released this year.

---

**Tweet 4/9**:
the economics are wild:

average anime film: $20-30M
average hollywood blockbuster: $150-250M

anime costs 10x less. makes equal or MORE money.

12:1 efficiency ratio.

---

**Tweet 5/9**:
here's the real difference:

hollywood got sanitized. focus-grouped to death. afraid of controversy.

anime stayed wild. vulgar. over the top. violent.

but every story still hides meaningful messages underneath.

---

**Tweet 6/9**:
demon slayer: brutal violence + themes about grief and resilience.
chainsaw man: absurd chaos + commentary on manipulation.
attack on titan: genocide + questions about freedom.

hollywood won't tell these stories anymore. too risky. too controversial. anime doesn't give a fuck.

---

**Tweet 7/9**:
meanwhile:

50% of gen z watches anime weekly.

only 25% watch the NFL.

america's next generation chose japanese storytelling over american sports.

---

**Tweet 8/9**:
hollywood will learn the wrong lesson. they'll make 10 more bad live-action anime adaptations.

the real lesson: audiences want stories that take risks. that go too far. that aren't afraid of being controversial while still having something meaningful to say.

---

**Tweet 9/9** (CTA):
gen z chose anime over the NFL because anime isn't afraid to be weird, violent, emotional, controversial.

hollywood's decline isn't about budgets. it's cultural decay. acceptance of safe, sanitized storytelling.

anime kept the wildness. that's why it's winning.

## VISUAL SUGGESTIONS

### Tweet 3 (After box office data):

**Type:** Chart/infographic
**Content:** 2025 Top 10 box office with anime films highlighted
**Why:** Makes data scannable, shareable as standalone image
**Create with:** /zoe → simple bar chart or text graphic

### Tweet 6 (After Thiel quote):

**Type:** Quote card or comparison visual
**Content:** "$20M → $670M (33x)" vs "$250M → $629M (2.5x)"
**Why:** Visual ROI comparison is instantly shareable
**Create with:** /zoe → split-screen comparison graphic

**Alternative:** Skip visuals entirely - thread performs well on text/data alone

---

## POSTING STRATEGY

### Best Times

- **Primary:** Tuesday-Thursday, 9-11 AM PT
- **Secondary:** Tuesday-Thursday, 1-3 PM PT
- **Avoid:** Weekends (business content performs worse)

**Why:** Tech Twitter peaks mid-week mornings, founder audience active

---

### First 60 Minutes (CRITICAL)

**Minute 0-5:**

- Post thread
- Reply to your own thread with: "the full research shows anime market will hit $28B in 2025. hollywood global box office: $33B. anime is already 85% the size of ALL hollywood theatrical. this is hostile takeover, not gradual growth."

**Minute 5-60:**

- Like every reply immediately
- Reply to thoughtful comments with follow-up questions
- Monitor for quote tweets, engage there too

**Why this matters:** First hour engagement signals to algorithm this is valuable content.

---

### 24-Hour Plan

**Hour 24:**

- Quote tweet thread with additional insight: "update: just learned demon slayer's merchandise revenue is 3-4x the box office. real ROI isn't 33x. it's more like 135x. hollywood doesn't even have this revenue stream for adult films."

**Why:** Resurfaces thread to different timezone, adds new info, extends reach

---

### Long-Term

**If performance strong (>100 likes in 24hrs):**

- Pin to profile
- Reference in future threads about efficiency, monopoly, or cultural trends
- Repurpose as LinkedIn post (reformat for Analyst voice, expand data)

---

## ALTERNATIVE HOOKS (A/B Testing)

### Hook Variant 1 (Sony Dependency Angle):

sony had no spider-man. no jumanji.

ONE anime film became 20% of their entire US box office.

this is what dependency looks like 🧵

**Why different:** Vulnerability framing vs efficiency framing
**Audience:** More entertainment industry than founder-focused

---

### Hook Variant 2 (Aggressive Opening):

$20M anime film just beat brad pitt's $250M blockbuster.

12:1 cost efficiency.

hollywood's not competing anymore. they're bleeding. 🧵

**Why different:** More confrontational, "bleeding" adds urgency
**Audience:** Same, but more provocative tone

---

### Hook Variant 3 (Question Format):

what happens when your competitor's costs are 12x lower and they're making MORE money than you?

ask hollywood. anime just did this to them. 🧵

**Why different:** Question format (curiosity-driven)
**Audience:** Strategy-focused, less data-focused

---

**Recommendation:** Use original hook (strongest data framing, most concrete)

---

---

## BONUS REPLY THREAD (Post After 2-3 Hours)

Use this to extend reach with additional data:

---

**Bonus Tweet 1:**
update: just learned the full numbers.

demon slayer box office: $670M
merchandise revenue: ~$2B (3-4x multiplier)

total: $2.7B from $20M investment.

that's not 33x ROI. that's 135x.

---

**Bonus Tweet 2:**
hollywood can't replicate this model:

• no merchandise culture for adult films
• actors own their likeness (can't sell action figures)
• union costs prevent low-budget production

anime built vertical integration. hollywood built star dependency.
