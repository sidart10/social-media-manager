## SCRIPT

### [0:00-0:03] HOOK

**"A viral tweet fooled millions about H-1B visas."**

**VISUAL**:
- Shot: Direct to camera, tight framing (head + shoulders)
- Text Overlay: "**800,000 H-1Bs?**" (RED, bold, center)
- Expression: Serious, authoritative

**AUDIO**: Start immediately, upbeat background music (low volume)

### [0:03-0:15] BEAT 1: The Viral Claim

**"Robert Sterling analyzed 868,000 H-1B 'applications' and claimed that's 10x the 85,000 annual cap. Chamath repeated it on the All-In Podcast. Even DeSantis cited it today to ban university H-1Bs."**

**VISUAL**:
- Shot: Talking head (medium close-up)
- B-roll: Sterling tweet screenshot (0:05-0:07)
- Text Overlay: "**868,000 applications**" (0:03-0:06)
- Text Overlay: "**85,000 cap = 10x oversubscribed?**" (0:09-0:12)

**TRANSITION**: "But here's what they got wrong..." →

---

### [0:15-0:32] BEAT 2: The Data Confusion

**"Sterling used DOL Labor Condition Applications – those are job postings, not actual visas. USCIS approves around 400,000 total H-1B petitions, but 65% are renewals. Only 141,000 are new. And of those, just 85,000 are subject to the cap."**

**VISUAL**:
- Shot: Talking head with hand gestures
- Text Overlay: "**LCA ≠ VISA**" (0:15-0:18, large, yellow)
- Text Overlay: "**400k total approvals**" (0:20-0:23)
- Text Overlay: "**65% renewals**" (0:24-0:26)
- Text Overlay: "**141k new visas**" (0:27-0:29)
- Funnel graphic visual (0:29-0:32)

**TRANSITION**: "So what's the ratio?" →

---

### [0:32-0:45] BEAT 3: The Real Numbers

**"For every LCA, only 40% become actual H-1B approvals. It's like saying 'job postings equal hires' – that's not how it works. Plus, Indians face a 140-year green card wait because of the 7% per-country cap."**

**VISUAL**:
- Shot: Talking head, leaning forward (emphasis)
- Text Overlay: "**2.5 LCAs : 1 visa**" (0:32-0:35)
- Text Overlay: "**140-year wait**" (0:40-0:43, red, dramatic)
- Expression: Shaking head at absurdity

**TRANSITION**: "The system's broken..." →

---

### [0:45-0:55] BEAT 4: The Two-Tier Problem

**The real issue? 30-50% of H-1Bs are low-wage IT staffing firms paying $80k-$100k. Tech companies pay $150k-$350k total comp. Same program, totally different outcomes.**

**VISUAL**:
- Shot: Talking head
- Text Overlay: "**IT staffing: $80-100k**" (0:46-0:49, left side)
- Text Overlay: "**Tech giants: $150-350k**" (0:49-0:52, right side)
- Split-screen visual comparison (0:52-0:55)

**TRANSITION**: "So..." →
