## IDEA CARD #4: The Minimalist Take

### Title
**"The Minimalist Mac Setup: 15 Apps That Actually Matter (Delete Everything Else)"**

### Hook Line
**"I had 127 apps. I deleted 112. My Mac runs faster, I'm more focused, and I get more done. Here are the 15 survivors."**

**Hook Type:** Contrarian/Minimalist
**Hook Variants:**
1. "Most Mac apps are bloat. You only need these 15."
2. "I deleted 100 apps. Kept 15. Productivity doubled."
3. "The minimalist Mac setup: 15 apps, zero distractions, maximum output."

---

### Outline (Content Beats)

**Beat 1: The Bloat Problem (0:00-2:00)**
- Before: 127 apps installed, cluttered, slow
- "Most apps I never used, some actively slowed me down"
- The minimalist challenge: What's essential?

**Beat 2: The Criteria (2:00-4:00)**
- Keep only if:
  - Used daily OR weekly
  - No built-in macOS alternative works as well
  - Solves specific problem better than anything else
- "Everything else gets deleted"

**Beat 3: The 15 Essential Apps (4:00-18:00)**

Each app (60-90 seconds):
1. **Raycast** - launches everything, no need for Spotlight
2. **Arc Browser** - replaces Chrome + tab management
3. **Rectangle** - window snapping (macOS should have this built-in)
4. **CleanShot X** - screenshots (built-in is basic)
5. **1Password** - passwords (iCloud Keychain lacks features)
6. **Notion** - notes + databases (Apple Notes too simple)
7. **Slack** - work communication (no alternative)
8. **Claude Code** - AI automation (the secret weapon)
9. **VS Code** - code editing (for devs)
10. **iTerm2** - terminal (built-in Terminal is fine, but iTerm2 is better)
11. **Stats** - system monitoring (built-in Activity Monitor is buried)
12. **Homebrew** - package manager (essential for CLI installs)
13. **Bartender** - menu bar (only if you have lots of apps running)
14. **Notion Calendar** - calendar (Apple Calendar works but Notion's is slicker)
15. **Spotify/Apple Music** - music (need ONE music app)

**Beat 4: What Got Deleted (18:00-20:00)**
- Categories I don't need: Fancy writing apps (VS Code + Notion is enough)
- Apps with redundant features
- "Productivity theater" apps (time trackers I never used)

**Beat 5: The Result (20:00-22:00)**
- Mac feels faster
- Less decision fatigue
- Focus improved
- "Sometimes less really is more"

**Beat 6: How to Do This Yourself (22:00-25:00)**
- Audit: `ls /Applications` - review everything
- Delete: Move to trash, test for a week
- Missing something? Reinstall (Homebrew makes it instant)
- Repeat every 6 months

## IDEA CARD #7: The LinkedIn Thought Leadership

### Title
**"How Claude Code Changed the Way I Set Up Development Machines"**

### Hook Line
**"I used to spend 4 hours configuring every new dev machine. Now it's 30 minutes, fully automated. Here's what changed."**

**Hook Type:** Transformation story
**Hook Variants:**
1. "AI stopped being a coding assistant. It became my Mac's setup engineer."
2. "I haven't manually installed an app in 6 months. Claude Code does it."
3. "The death of manual Mac configuration: How AI is changing developer workflows."

---

### Outline (LinkedIn Post Structure)

**Hook (First 140 chars - mobile truncation):**
"I used to spend 4 hours configuring every new dev machine. Now it's 30 minutes, fully automated. Here's what changed."

**Context (Build the story):**
"As a developer, I've set up dozens of Macs over the years. Every time, the same tedious routine:

1. Install Homebrew manually
2. Click through 30 app installers
3. Copy dotfiles from old machine
4. Configure Git, SSH keys, VS Code
5. Install Node, Python, Docker
6. Set up project directories
7. Clone repositories

Four hours minimum. Often longer if I forgot a step.

Last month, I tried something different."

**The Transformation:**
"Claude Code - Anthropic's AI coding assistant - can automate Mac setup.

Not just install apps. Full environment configuration.

Here's what I gave it:

Prompt 1: 'Install my core apps via Homebrew: Raycast, Rectangle, Arc, VS Code, iTerm2, Docker, Stats'

Prompt 2: 'Configure .zshrc with my aliases, NVM setup, and Oh My Zsh plugins'

Prompt 3: 'Set up Git with my credentials and generate SSH key'

Prompt 4: 'Install Node.js LTS, global packages, and clone my starter repos'

Prompt 5: 'Install VS Code extensions: ESLint, Prettier, GitLens, Copilot'

Total time: 28 minutes.
Manual time: 4+ hours.

That's an 87% time reduction."

**The Bigger Picture (Strategic insight):**
"This isn't just about Mac setup.

It's about treating infrastructure as code - but at the OS level.

My setup is now:
- Version-controlled (saved as prompts)
- Reproducible (works on any Mac)
- Shareable (team can use same setup)
- Documented (prompts explain what's installed)

The gap between 'fresh machine' and 'production-ready' is shrinking.

What used to take developers hours now takes minutes.

AI isn't just writing code anymore. It's managing our entire development environment."

**Call to Action:**
"If you're still setting up Macs manually, you're spending 4 hours on something that could take 30 minutes.

I made a full video walkthrough: [YouTube link]

And a GitHub Gist with all my prompts: [GitHub link]

What parts of your dev workflow are you automating? I'm curious what everyone's using."
