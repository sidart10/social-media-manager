  "production_notes": "This thumbnail is production-ready. Key strengths: (1) Text is extremely readable even at 320px width, (2) Mac visual provides tech context without competing with text, (3) Orange accent creates visual pop on YouTube's white/gray interface, (4) Professional without being corporate-boring. Suggestion: Could test A/B variant with subtitle 'Full Automation Tutorial' more prominent if CTR is low, but current version should perform well.",

If iteration needed, consider: (1) Testing 'MAC' in white instead of orange for more balanced weight, (2) Making accent nodes slightly larger (30px) for more visual presence, (3) Adding subtle Mac keyboard/trackpad outline below laptop for more realism. But current version should perform well without changes.",
