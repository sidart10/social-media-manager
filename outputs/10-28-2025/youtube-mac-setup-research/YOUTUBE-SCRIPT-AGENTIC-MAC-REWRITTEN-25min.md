## Full Script with Timing

### [0:00-0:05] HOOK (5 seconds)

**SCRIPT:**
"ai agents installed my apps, organized my files, and handle my morning routine. this is what agentic AI actually looks like."

**[VOICE NOTE]:**
Lowercase builder-philosopher mode - casual, direct, matter-of-fact delivery. This matches your authentic Twitter voice for this type of tech content. No corporate polish.

**[VISUAL DIRECTION]:**
- Shot: You at desk, direct to camera
- Style: Casual, confident, authentic
- Background: Mac setup visible, clean workspace
- Camera: Straight on, eye-level, tight shot

**[ON-SCREEN TEXT]:**
- "AI AGENTS RUN MY MAC" (appears at 0:01)
- Lowercase aesthetic (matches voice)
- Font: Simple sans-serif, high contrast
- Position: Center screen

**[AUDIO]:**
- No music yet (clean hook, voice only)
- Volume: Clear, close-mic sound
- Pacing: Moderate speed, let each word land

**[PRODUCTION NOTE]:**
The hook uses your lowercase philosophy voice - "ai agents" not "AI Agents". This is deliberate. It's how you actually talk on Twitter when discussing tech you're building. Don't correct it to formal capitalization.

---

### [0:05-2:00] INTRO - The Vision (115 seconds)

**SCRIPT:**
"here's what that means.

most people think AI is chatgpt in a browser. you ask questions, it writes code, maybe helps with your work.

this is different.

i built an AI agent that runs my mac. not just responds to prompts. actually takes action.

when i got this new mac, the agent:
- installed every app via homebrew. no clicking through installers.
- created my para file system - projects, areas, resources, archives - and started organizing files.
- set up mcp servers that let it control my browser, manage github, access my email.
- built a morning routine. i wake up, the agent has already summarized my emails, caught me up on slack, and briefed me on my calendar.

30 minutes of manual work became 5 minutes of AI automation.

and you can build this. today. on your mac.

this video shows you the architecture:
- how to install claude code and mcp servers
- how to create the master agent with modular skills
- how morning routine automation actually works
- the prompts and configs you can copy

this isn't theoretical. i've been running this for 30 days. it works.

let me show you how to build it."

**[VOICE NOTE]:**
Still lowercase casual for first paragraph, then shifts to Technical Teacher mode (proper caps, clear explanations) for the bullet points. This matches your voice pattern: casual intro ‚Üí structured explanation ‚Üí action close.

**[VISUAL DIRECTION]:**
- 0:05-0:45: You talking, setting up contrast (ChatGPT vs agents)
  - Camera: Same as hook, direct to camera
  - Energy: Conversational, building interest

- 0:45-1:15: Quick montage showing:
  - Terminal with apps installing automatically (Homebrew output flying by)
  - Finder showing PARA folders being created and files moving
  - Email/Slack summaries generating in terminal
  - Calendar briefing appearing

- 1:15-1:45: Back to you, building anticipation
  - Slight lean forward (increases energy)
  - Hand gestures to emphasize "you can build this"

- 1:45-2:00: Screen showing what's coming (chapter preview)
  - List the 4 main sections as overlay

**[ON-SCREEN TEXT]:**
- 0:25: "chatgpt = reactive" (crosses out with red X) ‚Üí "agents = proactive" (green checkmark)
- 1:00: Benefits list appears sequentially:
  - "‚úì apps installed" (0.5s delay)
  - "‚úì files organized" (0.5s delay)
  - "‚úì morning briefings" (0.5s delay)
  - "‚úì everything automated" (0.5s delay)
- 1:50: "you can build this today" (bold, center screen)

**[B-ROLL CLIPS NEEDED]:**
1. Terminal: Homebrew installing multiple apps (record this, speed up 2x)
2. Finder: Files moving into PARA folders automatically
3. Email client: Inbox with 47 unread ‚Üí Summary appearing
4. Slack: Notification badges ‚Üí Summary text
5. Calendar: Day view with meetings highlighted

**[MUSIC]:**
- Starts at 0:30 (subtle build)
- Genre: Tech-focused, clean electronic
- Tempo: Moderate (110-120 BPM)
- Volume: 15-20% (voice is primary)
- Mood: Anticipatory, building interest

**[PACING NOTE]:**
This intro is 115 seconds (almost 2 minutes). That's deliberate. We're setting up a big payoff. CJ's Syntax.fm video (100K+ views) spends 2-3 minutes on intro. Don't rush this. Build the vision.

### [2:00-4:00] INSTALLING CLAUDE CODE (2 minutes)

**SCRIPT:**
"first, get claude code running.

you need node.js:

```bash
# install homebrew (if you don't have it)
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# install node
brew install node
```

then install claude code:

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

authenticate:

```bash
claude
```

browser opens, sign in with anthropic account. free tier works for testing.

you're in. now we build the foundation."

**[VOICE NOTE]:**
Technical Teacher mode - clear, step-by-step, no fluff. This is your "teaching through building" voice from LinkedIn long-form posts.

**[VISUAL DIRECTION]:**
- 2:00-2:20: You explaining briefly
  - Camera: Same setup
  - Graphics: Show Claude Code logo, node.js logo (small, corner)

- 2:20-4:00: Terminal full-screen
  - Font: Large monospace (Menlo or SF Mono, 16-18pt)
  - Show each command being typed and executed
  - Real execution, not simulation
  - Authentication flow: Browser opens in PIP (picture-in-picture, small window in corner)

**[ON-SCREEN TEXT]:**
- 2:30: Commands appear as large overlays (stay visible 3-5s each):
  ```
  brew install node
  npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
  claude
  ```
- 3:45: "‚úì CLAUDE CODE READY" (green checkmark, center)

**[B-ROLL ALTERNATIVES]:**
If terminal screen gets boring:
- Cut to you explaining while terminal runs in background (PIP)
- Show Claude Code website documentation briefly
- Return to terminal for key moments (installation complete, authentication)

**[PRODUCTION NOTE]:**
This section is pure utility. Keep it tight. Don't over-explain. Developers who watch this will appreciate the speed. Non-developers will appreciate not being talked down to.

### [4:00-8:00] INSTALLING MCP SERVERS - The Foundation (4 minutes)

**SCRIPT:**
"okay, before we install apps or build agents, we need the foundation layer: mcp servers.

mcp - model context protocol - these are plugins that extend what AI can do.

by default, claude code can read files and run terminal commands. that's it.

with mcp servers, it can control your browser, manage github repos, organize your filesystem, access your email.

these are the ones i install:

**filesystem mcp:**
```bash
npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem
```

this lets claude code organize files, create directories, move stuff around. you'll see this with para setup.

**chrome devtools mcp:**
```bash
npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/server-chrome-devtools
```

claude code can now control chrome. navigate websites, click buttons, take screenshots, monitor network requests.

**github mcp:**
```bash
npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/server-github
```

manage repos, create issues, review prs, all from claude code.

**gmail mcp** (custom - you can build this):
```bash
# example of custom mcp server
# actual implementation depends on your setup
```

read inbox, categorize emails, flag urgent messages.

**slack mcp** (custom):
```bash
# another custom mcp example
```

read channels, summarize mentions, track important conversations.

now here's the important part: you configure which directories and permissions each mcp has.

filesystem mcp? i give it access to my home directory, but not system folders.

chrome mcp? specific websites only.

you control the boundaries. AI doesn't get carte blanche access to everything.

configuration goes in:
```
~/.config/claude/mcp-config.json
```

each mcp server listed with permissions. i'll link my config file - you can copy it.

mcp servers installed. now claude code can do real work."

**[VOICE NOTE]:**
Technical Teacher throughout. You're explaining a complex topic (MCP architecture) in simple terms. This matches your Analyst mode voice pattern: systematic explanation with framework organization (list each MCP, explain what it does, show boundaries).

**[VISUAL DIRECTION]:**
- 4:00-4:45: You explaining what MCP is
  - Camera: Talking head
  - Graphics: Simple diagram appears:
    ```
    Claude Code (center circle)
      ‚Üì MCP Servers (outer ring)
        ‚Üí Filesystem
        ‚Üí Chrome
        ‚Üí GitHub
        ‚Üí Gmail
        ‚Üí Slack
      ‚Üì Your Systems (outermost ring)
        ‚Üí Files
        ‚Üí Browser
        ‚Üí Code Repos
        ‚Üí Email
        ‚Üí Chat
    ```
  - Style: Clean, minimal, white background or dark mode

- 4:45-6:30: Terminal showing each MCP installation
  - Split screen: Terminal (left 70%) + Diagram updating (right 30%)
  - As each MCP installs, it lights up in the diagram
  - Filesystem installs ‚Üí "Filesystem" node glows green
  - Chrome installs ‚Üí "Chrome" node glows green
  - Continue for all 5 MCPs

- 6:30-7:30: Config file being edited
  - Show VS Code or text editor with `mcp-config.json`
  - Highlight the permissions structure:
    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "filesystem": {
          "command": "mcp-server-filesystem",
          "allowed_paths": [
            "/Users/sid/1.Projects",
            "/Users/sid/2.Sid",
            "/Users/sid/3.Resources",
            "/Users/sid/4.Archive",
            "/Users/sid/Downloads"
          ],
          "denied_paths": [
            "/System",
            "/Library"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  - Zoom in on key sections for 2-3 seconds each

- 7:30-8:00: Success confirmation
  - Terminal: `claude mcp list` command showing all MCPs loaded
  - Green checkmarks next to each MCP name

**[ON-SCREEN TEXT]:**
- 4:15: "MCP = MODEL CONTEXT PROTOCOL" (subtitle style, bottom third)
- 4:25: "PLUGINS FOR YOUR AI" (reinforces concept)
- 5:00: MCP server checklist appears (left side, persists through section):
  - ‚òê Filesystem
  - ‚òê Chrome DevTools
  - ‚òê GitHub
  - ‚òê Gmail (custom)
  - ‚òê Slack (custom)
  - As each installs, checkbox gets ‚úì and turns green

**[GRAPHICS NEEDED]:**
1. MCP Architecture Diagram (clean, animated)
   - Central node: Claude Code
   - Ring 1: MCP Servers
   - Ring 2: Your Systems
   - Connections light up as MCPs install

2. Permission Boundaries Visualization
   - Green zones: Allowed directories
   - Red zones: Denied/system directories
   - Simple folder tree with color coding

**[B-ROLL SUGGESTIONS]:**
- Config file JSON structure (pretty-printed)
- MCP server npm pages (quick flash, 1-2s each)
- Permission boundaries visualization (folder structure)
- Terminal output showing successful connections

**[PACING NOTE]:**
4 minutes on MCP is a LOT. But this is the foundation. Without understanding MCPs, the agent architecture doesn't make sense. CJ's video spends 5-6 minutes on Homebrew setup. We're doing same with MCPs. Worth it.

**[EVIDENCE INTEGRATION]:**
- Source: ClaudeCode.io - "MCP servers extend Claude Code capabilities beyond file operations"
- Source: GitHub @modelcontextprotocol - Official MCP server packages
- Your personal experience: "I've been running this for 30 days" (mentioned in intro, reinforces credibility here)

### [8:00-10:00] APP INSTALLATION - Using the MCPs (2 minutes)

**SCRIPT:**
"mcp servers are installed. now installing apps is trivial.

one prompt to claude code:

```
install these apps via homebrew:
raycast, rectangle, bartender, cleanshot x, stats, arc, notion, slack, notion calendar, iterm2, vs code, docker, 1password

show me the commands first.
```

claude code uses the filesystem mcp to verify directories, homebrew to install, then organizes everything.

watch."

**[PAUSE - show 20-30 seconds of execution, can speed up 1.5-2x]**

"all apps installing. automatically.

this used to take 2 hours of clicking. now it's 6 minutes.

but apps are just tools. the real power is what comes next."

**[VOICE NOTE]:**
Still Technical Teacher, but more casual. You're showing results, not explaining theory. Energy picks up slightly - excitement at seeing automation work.

**[VISUAL DIRECTION]:**
- 8:00-8:30: You showing the prompt
  - Camera: Talking head OR screen recording with your face in PIP (bottom-right)
  - Show the Claude Code interface clearly
  - Type the prompt (or show it pre-typed)

- 8:30-9:30: Terminal with installation progress (60 seconds)
  - Full screen terminal
  - Show Homebrew output:
    ```
    ==> Downloading raycast...
    ==> Installing raycast...
    ‚úì raycast installed
    ==> Downloading rectangle...
    ==> Installing rectangle...
    ‚úì rectangle installed
    ```
  - Speed up 1.5-2x (no one needs to watch full install time)
  - Show 3-4 apps installing, then cut to progress indicator:
    "Installing 13 apps... 5/13 complete"

- 9:30-10:00: Applications folder filling up
  - Finder view of /Applications
  - Icons appearing (can animate this)
  - Final shot: All 13 apps installed, grid view

**[ON-SCREEN TEXT]:**
- 8:45: "13 APPS INSTALLING..." (animated dots, shows progress)
- 9:30: Progress bar appears (0% ‚Üí 100% over 30 seconds)
- 9:55: "‚úì COMPLETE IN 6 MINUTES" (green, bold)

**[B-ROLL OPTIONS]:**
- Traditional way comparison (split screen):
  - Left: Someone clicking through installer windows (boring, slow)
  - Right: Your terminal (automated, fast)
- Time comparison overlay:
  - Manual: ~2 hours (2:00:00 timer)
  - AI-automated: 6 minutes (0:06:00 timer)

**[PACING NOTE]:**
Keep this SHORT. 2 minutes total. Apps aren't the story, agents are. Get through this quickly. The point is: "Look how easy this is with MCPs."

**[EVIDENCE INTEGRATION]:**
- Source: Research brief - "Developers spend 2-4 hours on manual Mac setup" (dev.to survey)
- Source: Your claim - "30 minutes of manual work became 5 minutes of AI automation"
- Contrast: Traditional setup (CJ's video: 60 minutes showing manual installs) vs Your setup (6 minutes automated)

### [10:00-12:00] PARA SYSTEM CREATION (2 minutes)

**SCRIPT:**
"para - projects, areas, resources, archives. tiago forte's system for organizing your digital life.

here's my structure:
- 1.Projects - active work with deadlines
- 2.Sid - personal stuff, learning, side projects
- 3.Resources - templates, references, materials
- 4.Archive - completed projects

numbered so they auto-sort to the top.

one prompt to claude code:

```
create my para folder structure:
1.Projects (with subfolders: Work, SideProjects)
2.Sid (with subfolders: Learning, Personal)
3.Resources (with subfolders: Templates, References)
4.Archive

use numbered prefixes for automatic sorting.
```

done. folders created. file system organized.

later, the file-organizer skill maintains this. moves files to the right categories based on content type and project status.

foundation is set. now we build the agent."

**[VOICE NOTE]:**
Still Technical Teacher. Brief explanation of PARA (for viewers unfamiliar), then quick execution. No over-explanation. The focus is: "Here's a system, here's how AI handles it."

**[VISUAL DIRECTION]:**
- 10:00-10:30: You explaining PARA briefly
  - Camera: Talking head
  - Graphics: PARA diagram appears (simple)
    ```
    1.Projects ‚Üí Active work
    2.Sid ‚Üí Personal
    3.Resources ‚Üí Reference
    4.Archive ‚Üí Completed
    ```
  - Keep it simple, don't over-explain (viewers can Google PARA if interested)

- 10:30-11:00: Prompt + execution
  - Terminal: Show the prompt
  - Claude Code processes the request
  - Terminal output: Folders being created
    ```
    Creating /Users/sid/1.Projects...
    Creating /Users/sid/1.Projects/Work...
    Creating /Users/sid/1.Projects/SideProjects...
    ‚úì Complete
    ```

- 11:00-12:00: Finder showing PARA structure created
  - Finder window: Home directory
  - Show the numbered folders in list view (they sort to top)
  - Expand each folder to show subfolders
  - Clean, organized, color-coded folders (optional: add folder icons)

**[ON-SCREEN TEXT]:**
- 10:10: PARA acronym breakdown:
  ```
  P = Projects (Active)
  A = Areas (Ongoing)
  R = Resources (Reference)
  A = Archive (Complete)
  ```
- 11:15: Folder tree visualization (overlay on Finder):
  ```
  üìÅ 1.Projects
    üìÅ Work
    üìÅ SideProjects
  üìÅ 2.Sid
    üìÅ Learning
    üìÅ Personal
  üìÅ 3.Resources
    üìÅ Templates
    üìÅ References
  üìÅ 4.Archive
  ```

**[B-ROLL OPTIONS]:**
- Traditional folder organization (messy Desktop, Downloads full of files)
- PARA system (clean, organized, easy to navigate)
- Files automatically moving to correct folders (can show this later when file-organizer skill runs)

**[PACING NOTE]:**
KEEP THIS BRIEF. 2 minutes max. PARA is context, not the focus. The point is: "AI can organize your file system according to any framework you want." Move quickly to agent architecture (the real story).

**[EVIDENCE INTEGRATION]:**
- Source: Tiago Forte - PARA method creator (mention briefly, no deep dive)
- Source: Your implementation - "I use this system, it works"
- Contrast: Manual folder creation (tedious, easy to mess up) vs AI-automated (perfect structure, 30 seconds)

### [12:00-18:00] BUILDING THE AGENT ARCHITECTURE (6 minutes) ‚≠ê CORE CONTENT

**SCRIPT:**
"alright, here's where we build the actual agent system.

one master agent. multiple skills. mcp servers providing the capabilities.

let me show you the architecture.

**creating the master agent file:**

i create `.claude/agents/mac-master-agent.md`:

```markdown
# Mac Master Agent

## Role
i manage your mac and daily operations. i have access to your filesystem, browser, github, email, and slack through mcp servers. i can install software, organize files, and provide morning briefings.

## Available Skills

### email-summary
- reads gmail inbox via gmail mcp
- categorizes by urgency (client, team, automated, noise)
- flags action items
- ignores newsletters and notifications

### slack-catchup
- reads all slack workspaces via slack mcp
- summarizes mentions and dms
- identifies urgent threads
- tracks important discussions

### calendar-briefing
- reviews google calendar via calendar mcp
- identifies meetings and prep time needed
- flags scheduling conflicts
- calculates focus time blocks

### file-organizer
- uses filesystem mcp to organize downloads
- moves files to appropriate para folders
- applies naming conventions
- maintains folder structure

### app-installer
- installs software via homebrew
- verifies installations
- handles dependencies
- configures initial settings

## MCP Servers Available
- @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem (access: ~/1.Projects, ~/2.Sid, ~/3.Resources, ~/4.Archive, ~/Downloads)
- @modelcontextprotocol/server-chrome-devtools (port 9222)
- @modelcontextprotocol/server-github (token configured)
- @custom/gmail-mcp (readonly inbox access)
- @custom/slack-mcp (readonly workspace access)

## Example Invocations

When user says: "morning briefing"
Execute: email-summary skill + slack-catchup skill + calendar-briefing skill in sequence

When user says: "organize downloads"
Execute: file-organizer skill

When user says: "install [app-name]"
Execute: app-installer skill
```

this is the agent definition. one file that describes its role, its skills, and what it can access.

**creating the skills:**

skills live in `.claude/skills/` directory. each skill is focused on one thing.

here's the email-summary skill (`.claude/skills/email-summary.md`):

```markdown
# Email Summary Skill

## Purpose
read gmail inbox and provide actionable summary

## MCP Servers Used
- gmail-mcp (readonly)

## Instructions
1. fetch unread emails from last 12 hours
2. categorize each:
   - client emails (high priority)
   - team emails (medium priority)
   - automated notifications (ignore)
   - newsletters (ignore)
3. for client and team emails:
   - extract sender, subject, key points
   - identify if response needed
   - flag urgency (urgent, today, this week, none)
4. output structured summary:
   - urgent items first
   - action items with deadlines
   - fyi items for awareness
   - total count by category

## Example Output
\```
Email Summary (Last 12 Hours):

URGENT (Response Needed Today):
1. Client: API integration question - @john
2. Team: Deployment schedule discussion - @sarah

ACTION ITEMS (This Week):
3. PR review request - @teammate
4. Meeting reschedule - @manager

FYI:
- 12 team updates in #engineering
- 8 github notifications

IGNORED:
- 23 newsletters
- 15 automated notifications

Total: 47 emails, 4 require attention
\```
```

slack-catchup skill is similar structure. calendar-briefing skill too.

each skill:
- has one job
- uses specific mcp servers
- outputs structured data
- master agent orchestrates them

this is modular agent design. not one giant prompt. focused skills that compose."

**[VOICE NOTE]:**
Technical Teacher mode throughout. This is the most complex section, so you're being extra clear. You're showing file structures, explaining concepts, building understanding step by step. This matches your Analyst voice: systematic framework + enumeration + specific examples.

3. Skill Execution Flow
   - User command
   - Agent routing
   - Skill execution
   - MCP interaction
   - Result output

**[B-ROLL SUGGESTIONS]:**
- VS Code showing agent file being created (clean, readable)
- Skills directory with multiple .md files
- File organization happening in real-time (files moving to PARA folders)
- Terminal showing agent responding to commands

**[PACING NOTE]:**
6 minutes on agent architecture. This is the CORE of the video. Take your time here. Show actual files. Let viewers understand the structure. This is the differentiator - no one else is showing how to build modular agent systems.

CJ's Syntax.fm video spends 10+ minutes on app-by-app walkthrough. We're spending 6 minutes on agent architecture. This is what makes your video unique and valuable.

**[EVIDENCE INTEGRATION]:**
- Source: Claude Code documentation - "MCP servers enable extensibility"
- Source: Your experience - "I've been running this for 30 days"
- Architecture pattern: This is a novel approach (no existing videos show this)
- Proof: Morning routine demo is coming next (builds anticipation)

**[PRODUCTION NOTE - CRITICAL]:**
This is the technical core. Go slower here. Developers will appreciate the detail. Non-developers will appreciate seeing the structure (even if they don't understand every detail).

Show actual file contents. Don't just talk about them. Viewers should be able to pause and read the file if they want to.

### [18:00-21:00] MORNING ROUTINE DEMO - Agents Working (3 minutes)

**SCRIPT:**
"okay, agent is built. skills are defined. mcp servers are running.

now watch it work.

it's 8am. i just woke up. haven't looked at my computer yet.

i open my mac, launch claude code, and say:

```
morning briefing
```

that's it. two words.

the master agent sees that invocation. it knows to run three skills in sequence: email-summary, slack-catchup, calendar-briefing.

watch what happens."

**[PAUSE - show agent executing, 30-40 seconds]**

"**email-summary skill running:**

'checking gmail... 47 unread emails.

urgent (response needed today):
1. client question about api integration - john
2. deployment schedule - sarah

action items (this week):
3. pr review - teammate
4. meeting reschedule - manager

ignored: 23 newsletters, 15 automated notifications.

4 emails need your attention.'

**slack-catchup skill running:**

'checking slack workspaces...

mentions: 8 total
- #engineering: deployment discussion (3 mentions)
- #product: feature prioritization (2 mentions)
- dm from manager: positive feedback on proposal

no urgent action items. catch up during 10am break.'

**calendar-briefing skill running:**

'today's schedule:

meetings:
- 10am: team standup (15 min)
- 2pm: client demo (1 hour) - prep needed: review slides in drive
- 4pm: 1-on-1 with sarah (30 min)

focus time: 8-10am (now), 12-2pm

conflict detected: client demo overlaps usual lunch. suggest move lunch to 1pm.'

all of that in 3 minutes.

i know exactly what needs attention. what's urgent. what can wait. where my focus time is.

the old way: 30 minutes of reading emails, scrolling slack, checking calendar, getting oriented.

ai agents did it in 3 minutes while i made coffee.

this is agentic AI. proactive. autonomous. actually useful."

**[VOICE NOTE]:**
Technical Teacher ‚Üí Builder-Philosopher hybrid. You're demonstrating results (Teacher) but also reflecting on the impact (Builder-Philosopher: "this is agentic AI"). Energy is higher here - genuine excitement at seeing it work.

**[VISUAL DIRECTION]:**
- 18:00-18:20: You at desk, morning scene
  - Shot: Wide, showing coffee cup, natural morning light
  - Energy: Calm, just woke up vibe
  - Action: Open MacBook, casual posture

- 18:20-18:40: Terminal - you type "morning briefing"
  - Close-up on terminal
  - Typing animation (can be sped up slightly)
  - Hit Enter
  - Pause (1-2 seconds) before agent responds

- 18:40-20:00: Split screen or sequential showing skills running:

  **Email summary (40 seconds):**
  - Left 50%: Gmail interface blurred in background (show inbox with 47 unread)
  - Right 50%: Terminal with summary generating
  - Text appears line by line (simulating real-time generation)
  - Highlight urgent items in red, action items in yellow, FYI in blue

  **Slack summary (40 seconds):**
  - Left 50%: Slack with notification badges (8 mentions)
  - Right 50%: Terminal with Slack summary
  - Same line-by-line generation style

  **Calendar briefing (40 seconds):**
  - Left 50%: Google Calendar showing day view with 3 meetings
  - Right 50%: Terminal with calendar briefing
  - Highlight conflict (lunch overlapping client demo) in red

- 20:30-21:00: You reading the briefing, satisfied expression
  - Camera: Back to you
  - Action: Sipping coffee, nodding, looking prepared
  - Energy: Calm confidence (you're in control, not overwhelmed)

**[ON-SCREEN TEXT]:**
- 18:30: "morning briefing" command (large, center, terminal font)
- 18:50: "AGENT ORCHESTRATING SKILLS..." (animated dots)
- 19:00: Email summary appears as overlay (key points highlighted):
  ```
  üìß EMAIL SUMMARY
  üö® 2 Urgent
  ‚è∞ 2 Action Items
  ‚ÑπÔ∏è 20 FYI
  üóëÔ∏è 38 Ignored

  üïê 3 Meetings
  üß† 2 Focus Blocks
  ‚ö†Ô∏è 1 Conflict
  ```
- 20:45: "3 MINUTES TOTAL" (bold, green, center)

**[EMOTIONAL PEAK - PRODUCTION NOTE]:**
This is where viewers see the real value. The payoff for 18 minutes of setup. Show your genuine reaction. This actually saves time. This is powerful.

Before/after comparison:
- Before: Overwhelmed by 47 emails, 8 Slack pings, packed calendar
- After: Calm, caffeinated, fully briefed, ready to work

Make viewers feel the difference.

**[B-ROLL CLIPS NEEDED]:**
1. Coffee being made (while AI works) - shows you're not even at computer
2. Gmail inbox: 47 unread (overwhelming visual)
3. Slack: Notification badges everywhere
4. Calendar: Meetings packed together (busy visual)
5. You calmly reading AI summary (in control)

**[MUSIC]:**
- Ramp up energy from previous sections
- Tempo increases slightly (115-120 BPM ‚Üí 125-130 BPM)
- Volume stays at 15-20% (voice primary)
- Mood: Accomplishment, satisfaction

**[PACING NOTE]:**
3 minutes for morning routine demo. This is FAST compared to 6 minutes on agent architecture. But we're showing results, not explaining structure. Keep the energy up. Show each skill quickly but clearly.

**[EVIDENCE INTEGRATION]:**
- Source: Your claim - "30 minutes of manual work ‚Üí 3 minutes of AI automation"
- Evidence: Live demo (this is the proof)
- Contrast: Traditional morning routine (shown briefly at 20:00-20:15) vs AI-automated (shown in demo)

**[PRODUCTION NOTE - EMOTIONAL BEAT]:**
At 20:30-21:00, when you're back on camera reading the briefing - this is the money shot. Show genuine satisfaction. This isn't fake excitement. This is: "I built this, it actually works, and it saves me time every single day."

That authenticity is what makes viewers trust you and want to build it themselves.

### [21:00-22:00] THE BIGGER PICTURE - Agentic AI (1 minute)

**SCRIPT:**
"this is what agentic AI actually means.

not chatgpt in a browser. not copilot suggesting code.

AI agents that:
- take action autonomously
- orchestrate multiple skills
- use mcp servers to interact with your systems
- give you exactly what you need

we just built an AI layer on top of macos.

the agent manages your mac. you manage the agent.

you're not fighting with your computer anymore. you're collaborating with AI that understands your environment and can change things.

this is where computing is going."

**[VOICE NOTE]:**
Visionary mode (from your voice profile: forward-looking, enthusiast energy). This matches your LinkedIn voice when discussing bigger implications: "AI stopped being software. it became my operating system" (lowercase for impact).

**[VISUAL DIRECTION]:**
- 21:00-22:00: You talking, philosophical mode
  - Camera: Tight shot, direct to camera

**[MUSIC]:**
- Build to crescendo
  - Volume increases to 20-25%
  - Tempo stays at 125-130 BPM
  - Add melodic element (inspirational)
  - Mood: Forward-looking, optimistic

**[PACING NOTE]:**
1 minute on vision. Keep it tight. Don't over-philosophize. Make the point clearly: "This is where computing is going." Then move to practical next steps.

**[EVIDENCE INTEGRATION]:**
- Your perspective: "AI stopped being software" (your Twitter voice - lowercase for authenticity)
- Contrast: ChatGPT (reactive) vs Agents (proactive)
- Future: "This is where computing is going" (visionary, but grounded in what you just showed)

**[PRODUCTION NOTE]:**
This section transitions from demo (practical) to vision (philosophical) to next steps (actionable). It's the bridge. Keep it brief but impactful.

- each skill uses specific mcps
- modular, focused, composable

**step 5:** invoke your agent
- `claude -a mac-master-agent 'morning briefing'`
- agent orchestrates skills
- summaries generate automatically

i've linked everything:
- github repo with agent + all skills (full code)
- mcp server installation guide
- config files (permissions, settings)
- video timestamps for reference

fork it. customize your skills. build your agent system.

this works today."

- Tempo holds at 125-130 BPM
- Fade out naturally over last 5 seconds

**[PACING NOTE]:**
60 seconds for CTA. Not rushed, but direct. You've given 24 minutes of value. Now you're asking for one thing: subscribe if you want more. Fair trade.

**[PRODUCTION NOTE]:**
End with your lowercase philosophical statement. This is your signature. It's memorable. It's shareworthy. It's authentically you.

"ai agents stopped being software. they became infrastructure."

No capitalization. No emoji. Just the truth as you see it.

## Hook Variants (3 Alternative Openings for A/B Testing)

**Original Hook:**
"ai agents installed my apps, organized my files, and handle my morning routine. this is what agentic AI actually looks like."

**Variant #1: Question Hook (Curiosity-Driven)**
"what if your mac could set itself up, organize your files, and brief you every morning? i built that. let me show you."

- **Why:** Questions drive engagement (psychological pull to answer)
- **Voice:** Still lowercase casual, but adds mystery
- **Visual:** Same as original (you at desk, direct to camera)
- **CTR Prediction:** 8-10% (question hooks perform well)

**Variant #2: Bold Claim Hook (Authority)**
"i haven't manually installed an app in 6 months. haven't checked email first thing in years. AI agents do it for me. here's the system."

- **Why:** Bold claims create skepticism ‚Üí need to watch to verify
- **Voice:** Lowercase builder-philosopher (confident, contrarian)
- **Visual:** Same setup, slightly more serious expression
- **CTR Prediction:** 9-11% (boldest claim, highest risk/reward)

**Variant #3: Transformation Hook (Before/After)**
"my mac used to take 4 hours to set up. now it takes 30 minutes, fully automated. here's how AI agents changed my workflow."

- **Why:** Time-saving angle is immediately valuable (practical appeal)
- **Voice:** Lowercase + numbers (your product comparison formula)
- **Visual:** Can show split-screen: manual setup (left) vs AI setup (right)
- **CTR Prediction:** 7-9% (safe, clear value proposition)

**Testing Recommendation:**
- Start with **Original Hook** (broad appeal, establishes concept)
- If retention drops <50% in first 30 seconds, test **Variant #2** (boldest)
- For developer-focused re-upload, use **Variant #3** (practical)
