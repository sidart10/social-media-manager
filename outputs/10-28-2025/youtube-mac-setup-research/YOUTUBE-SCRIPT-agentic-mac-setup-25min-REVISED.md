### [0:05-2:00] INTRO - The Vision (115 seconds)

**SCRIPT:**
"Here's what I mean.

Most people think AI is just ChatGPT in a browser tab. You ask it questions, it gives you answers, maybe writes some code. That's version one.

This is different.

I'm using Claude Code with MCP servers - Model Context Protocol - which lets AI agents actually interact with your system. Not just respond to prompts. Actually take action.

So when I got this new Mac, I didn't set it up manually. I let AI agents do it.

They installed every app via Homebrew. No clicking through installers.

They created my PARA file organization system - Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives - and started organizing files automatically.

They handle my morning routine now. I wake up, AI agents have already summarized my emails, caught me up on Slack, and briefed me on my calendar.

This video is going to show you exactly how I built this.

And here's the thing - you can copy every prompt I use. This isn't some theoretical future thing. This works today. On your Mac. Right now.

We're covering:
- How to install Claude Code and authenticate it
- How to install apps completely automatically via AI
- How to set up MCP servers that extend what AI can do
- How to create morning routine agents that actually save you time
- And the bigger picture: what agentic AI means for computing

Let's go."

### [2:00-4:00] INSTALLING CLAUDE CODE (2 minutes)

**SCRIPT:**
"First step: get Claude Code running.

You need Node.js. If you don't have it:

```bash
# Install Homebrew first (if needed)
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# Then install Node
brew install node
```

Once you have Node, install Claude Code globally:

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

Takes about 30 seconds.

Now authenticate:

```bash
claude
```

It opens your browser, you sign in with your Anthropic account. If you don't have one, create it - there's a free tier to test this.

You're in. Now we can start building."

**[VISUAL DIRECTION]:**
- 2:00-2:30: You explaining what Claude Code is
- 2:30-4:00: Full-screen terminal recording
  - Show each command
  - Real-time execution
  - Authentication flow in browser window (picture-in-picture)

**[ON-SCREEN TEXT]:**

- 3:30: "AUTHENTICATED ‚úì"

**[PRODUCTION NOTE]:**
- Clean terminal (no clutter, readable theme)
- Zoom terminal text (must be readable at 1080p)

---

### [4:00-8:00] APP INSTALLATION - Complete Automation (4 minutes)

**SCRIPT:**
"Alright, now watch this.

I'm going to ask Claude Code to install every app I need. No clicking. No visiting websites. No dragging to Applications folder.

Here's my prompt:

```
Install these apps via Homebrew:

Productivity:
- Raycast (Spotlight replacement)
- Rectangle (window management)
- Bartender (menu bar manager)
- CleanShot X (screenshots)
- Stats (system monitor)

Apps:
- Arc browser
- Notion (notes)
- Slack (communication)
- Notion Calendar

Development:
- iTerm2 (terminal)
- VS Code (editor)
- Docker Desktop
- 1Password (password manager)

Show me what you'll execute, then run it.
```

Watch what happens."

**[PAUSE - Show Claude Code response]**

"Claude Code responded:

'I'll install these via Homebrew cask. Here are the commands:

```bash
brew install --cask raycast rectangle bartender-4 cleanshot stats
brew install --cask arc notion slack notion-calendar
brew install --cask iterm2 visual-studio-code docker 1password
```

Should I proceed?'

I say yes."

**[PAUSE - Show installation]**

"And it's running. Every app. Automatically.

Raycast... installed.
Rectangle... installed.
Arc browser... installed.

All of them.

The manual way? You'd spend two hours visiting websites, downloading DMG files, dragging to Applications, configuring permissions.

Claude Code just did it in six minutes while I made coffee.

But that's just the beginning. Installing apps is the easy part. Now it gets interesting."

**[VISUAL DIRECTION]:**

- 7:30: "‚úì 13 APPS INSTALLED IN 6 MINUTES"

**[B-ROLL]:**
- Quick cuts of each app launching for first time
- Permission dialogs being handled
- Applications folder with new apps

**[PACING NOTE]:**
- Speed up installation footage to 1.5-2x if needed
- Don't show every single app - representativ sample is enough

---

### [8:00-10:00] PARA SYSTEM - File Organization (2 minutes)

**SCRIPT:**
"Apps are installed. Now let's organize the file system.

I use the PARA method - that's Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives. It's Tiago Forte's system for organizing your entire digital life.

Here's how it works:
- **1.Projects** - Active work projects with deadlines
- **2.Sid** - Personal stuff, learning, side projects
- **3.Resources** - Reference materials, templates, assets
- **4.Archive** - Completed projects, old files

Numbered folders so they auto-sort to the top.

Normally I'd create these folders manually in Finder, then drag files around organizing everything.

Here's what I tell Claude Code:

```
Create my PARA folder structure in my home directory:
- 1.Projects
- 2.Sid
- 3.Resources
- 4.Archive

Then create these subfolders:
- 1.Projects/Work
- 1.Projects/SideProjects
- 2.Sid/Learning
- 2.Sid/Personal
- 3.Resources/Templates
- 3.Resources/References

Use numbered prefixes for automatic sorting.
```

Done. Folder structure created. Twenty seconds.

Later, when I need to organize files, I can ask Claude Code: 'Move these design files to 3.Resources/Templates' and it handles it.

That's the Filesystem MCP server working - Claude Code can read, write, and organize your files with permission."

**[VISUAL DIRECTION]:**
- 8:00-8:30: Quick PARA explanation (you talking, simple diagram on screen)
- 8:30-9:00: Show the prompt
- 9:00-9:30: Terminal executing, folders being created
- 9:30-10:00: Finder view showing the created PARA structure (clean, organized)

**[ON-SCREEN TEXT]:**
- 8:10: PARA acronym breakdown:
  - **P**rojects
  - **A**reas
  - **R**esources
  - **A**rchives
- 9:15: Folder tree visualization appearing

**[B-ROLL]:**
- Finder window showing folder structure
- Files being moved into categories (demo)
- Before/after comparison (messy Downloads vs organized PARA)

**[PRODUCTION NOTE]:**
- Keep PARA explanation brief (it's context, not the focus)
- Emphasis: Claude Code + Filesystem MCP can organize your entire digital life

---

### [10:00-15:00] MCP SERVERS - Extending AI Capabilities (5 minutes)

**SCRIPT:**
"Alright, here's where Claude Code becomes really powerful.

By itself, Claude Code can read and write files, run terminal commands, that's it.

But with MCP servers - Model Context Protocol - you can extend what it can do.

Think of MCP servers as plugins for your AI. Each one gives Claude Code access to a different system or service.

Let me show you the ones I install.

**Filesystem MCP:**
Gives Claude Code controlled access to your files. You saw this with PARA - it created folders, it can move files, organize directories.

Installation:

```bash
npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem
```

Then configure it in Claude Code settings to only access specific directories. You don't want AI having access to everything - just the folders you specify.

**Chrome DevTools MCP:**
This one's wild. It lets Claude Code control your browser.

Navigate to websites, click buttons, fill forms, take screenshots, monitor network requests, run performance audits.

Installation:

```bash
npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/server-chrome-devtools
```

Launch Chrome with debugging enabled:

```bash
/Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222
```

Now Claude Code can interact with any website. I use this for testing web apps, automating research, extracting data.

**GitHub MCP:**
Connects Claude Code to GitHub. Create issues, manage pull requests, read commits, trigger workflows.

Installation:

```bash
npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/server-github
```

Add your GitHub token to config, and Claude Code can manage your repos directly.

**Slack MCP:**
Read messages, post updates, search channels. Your morning Slack catch-up becomes: 'Claude, summarize my Slack mentions from overnight.'

**Google Drive MCP:**
Access docs, sheets, files. 'Claude, summarize the meeting notes from last week's folder' - it reads Drive, gives you the summary.

There are dozens of MCP servers. Postgres for databases. Puppeteer for advanced browser automation. Custom ones you can build yourself.

The point: MCP servers turn Claude Code from a coding assistant into an agentic AI that can interact with your entire digital environment.

Let me show you what that actually means."

### [15:00-20:00] MORNING ROUTINE AGENTS (5 minutes)

**SCRIPT:**
"Okay, this is my favorite part.

Every morning, before I even sit down at my desk, AI agents are already working.

Let me show you what I mean.

**Email Summary Agent:**

I have hundreds of emails. Most are noise. Some are urgent.

Instead of reading through everything, I ask Claude Code:

```
Check my Gmail inbox. Summarize unread emails from the last 12 hours. Flag anything urgent or from clients. Ignore newsletters and automated notifications.
```

Claude Code + Gmail MCP reads my inbox, categorizes everything, gives me a summary:

'You have 47 unread emails. 3 require response:
1. Client question about API integration (urgent)
2. Meeting reschedule request from Sarah
3. GitHub PR review from teammate

The rest are newsletters, automated notifications, and low-priority updates.'

I know exactly what needs attention. Two minutes instead of thirty.

**Slack Catch-Up Agent:**

Same thing for Slack. Multiple workspaces, dozens of channels.

```
Check my Slack workspaces. Summarize mentions and direct messages from overnight. Flag anything that needs response today.
```

'You were mentioned in 8 messages:
- #engineering: Discussion about deployment schedule
- #product: Question about feature prioritization
- DM from manager: Feedback on your proposal (positive)

No urgent action items. You can catch up during your 10am break.'

Perfect. I know what happened without scrolling through every channel.

**Calendar Briefing Agent:**

```
Review my calendar for today. Summarize meetings, prep time needed, conflicts.
```

'Today's schedule:
- 10am: Team standup (15 min)
- 2pm: Client demo (1 hour) - PREP: Review slides from Drive
- 4pm: 1-on-1 with Sarah (30 min)

You have 2 hours of focus time: 8-10am and 12-2pm.

Conflict: Client demo overlaps with your usual lunch. Move lunch to 1pm.'

All of this happens in five minutes. My entire morning context.

The old way? I'd spend thirty minutes reading emails, checking Slack, reviewing calendar, getting oriented.

AI agents do it while I'm making coffee.

This is what agentic AI actually means. Not just answering questions. Taking action. Gathering information. Giving you exactly what you need."

### [20:00-22:00] THE BIGGER PICTURE - Agentic AI (2 minutes)

**SCRIPT:**
"So what just happened here?

We didn't just install some apps and write some scripts.

We built an agentic AI layer on top of macOS.

AI agents that:
- Set up your system automatically
- Organize your digital life
- Handle routine tasks while you sleep
- Give you exactly the information you need, when you need it

This is different from AI chat. Chat is reactive. You ask, it answers.

Agents are proactive. They take action. They gather context. They make decisions.

And here's what's wild: this is running locally on your Mac. With MCP servers, your AI has controlled access to:
- Your file system
- Your browser
- Your GitHub repos
- Your email and Slack
- Your calendar
- Any service with an MCP server

The gap between 'I want to do this' and 'it's done' is shrinking.

You're not fighting with your computer anymore. You're collaborating with AI that understands your system and can actually change things.

This is what computing looks like when AI agents are part of the operating system."

- Morning routine = relatable human story

**Editing Time:** 6-8 hours (down from 10-12)
- Less granular app footage needed
- More terminal screen recordings (easier to capture)
- Agent demos are quick (summaries, not deep dives)

---

### Hook Variants (Revised)

**Original:**
"I let AI agents run my Mac for 30 days. They set up everything, organized my files, and handle my morning routine. Let me show you what that actually looks like."

**Variant 1 (Bold Claim):**
"AI agents installed my apps, organized my files, and read my email while I made coffee. This is computing's future."

**Variant 2 (Question):**
"What if your Mac had AI agents that worked while you slept? I built it. Here's how."

**Variant 3 (Transformation):**
"I stopped setting up my Mac manually. AI agents do it now. Every app. Every folder. Every morning briefing."

**Variant 4 (Provocative - Your Style):**
"ai agents stopped being software. they became my mac's operating system"

^^ That one's lowercase builder-philosopher mode - might be your authentic voice for this

## What Changed From Original Script

**Original focus:** Mac app installation tutorial with some automation
**Revised focus:** Agentic AI transforming how you interact with your Mac

**What got MORE emphasis:**
- MCP servers (5 min dedicated section)
- Morning routine agents (5 min demo showing real impact)
- The vision/philosophy (agentic AI as operating layer)

**What got LESS emphasis:**
- Individual app reviews (just list + install, no deep dives)
- Manual comparisons (mentioned but not belabored)
- Pro tips (streamlined to essentials)

**Why better:**
- Bigger story (AI revolution, not productivity hack)
- More unique (zero competition on MCP servers + morning agents)
- More shareable (vision content gets discussed)
- More authentic to your actual use case

## Missing Information I Need

**To finalize script, tell me:**

1. **Which MCP servers do you actually use?**
   - Gmail MCP exists?
   - Slack MCP exists?
   - Or are you building custom ones?

2. **Morning routine specifics:**
   - What email summaries do you actually get?
   - What Slack info do you want flagged?
   - How detailed should the calendar briefing be?

3. **Your actual terminal/editor:**
   - iTerm2, Warp, or default Terminal?
   - VS Code, Cursor, or other?

4. **Tone for hook:**
   - Professional: "I let AI agents run my Mac..."
   - Casual: "ai agents stopped being software..." (lowercase, your style)
   - Which feels more you?

Let me know and I'll finalize the script with exact details!
