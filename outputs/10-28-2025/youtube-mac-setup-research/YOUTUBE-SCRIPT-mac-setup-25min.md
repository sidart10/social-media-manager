---

### [0:05-2:00] INTRO - The Problem & Promise (115 seconds)

**SCRIPT:**
"Let me show you what I mean.

Every time you get a new Mac, you go through the same routine. Install Homebrew. Click through 30 different app installers. Copy your dotfiles from your old machine. Configure Git, set up SSH keys, install Node, Python, Docker. Set up VS Code with all your extensions.

Four hours minimum. Sometimes longer if you forget something.

I've done this dozens of times. It's tedious. It's repetitive. And honestly, it shouldn't be manual anymore.

So today I'm showing you a different approach. I'm going to set up my entire Mac using Claude Code - Anthropic's AI coding assistant. Not just installing apps. Full environment configuration. Dotfiles, Git, development tools, everything.

And here's the best part: you can copy the exact prompts I use. I'm dropping them all in a GitHub Gist linked below.

By the end of this video, you'll see:
- Every essential app I install, organized by category
- How Claude Code automates the installation and configuration
- A split-screen comparison showing manual versus AI setup
- The exact prompts you can use on your own Mac

Let's get started."

**[VISUAL DIRECTION]:**
- 0:05-0:30: Screen recording montage - clicking through app installers (fast cuts, tedious feeling)
- 0:30-1:00: You talking to camera, explaining the pain
- 1:00-1:30: Claude Code terminal preview (teaser of what's coming)
- 1:30-2:00: Quick preview of final result (your setup completed, clean desktop)

**[ON-SCREEN TEXT]:**
- 0:10: "THE OLD WAY: 4+ HOURS" (over manual clicking montage)
- 1:05: "THE NEW WAY: AI AUTOMATION" (over Claude Code terminal)
- 1:40: List appears: "‚úì Apps ‚úì Dotfiles ‚úì Git ‚úì Dev Tools ‚úì Everything"

**[B-ROLL SUGGESTIONS]:**
- Manual app installation clicks (App Store, dmg files opening)
- Terminal commands being typed manually
- Copying files between Finder windows
- System Preferences clicking

**[MUSIC]:**
- Start subtle background music at 0:30 (upbeat, tech-focused, not distracting)
- Volume: 15-20% (voice is primary)

### [2:00-8:00] ESSENTIAL APPS - Quick Tour (6 minutes)

**SCRIPT:**
"Before we dive into the automation, let me show you what I'm actually installing. These are the apps I use every single day, organized by category.

**Quick Launcher:**
Raycast. This replaces Spotlight. Launches apps, runs scripts, manages clipboard, searches the web. The free tier has everything you need. I use Raycast Pro for the AI features, but start with free.

Free alternative: Alfred basic version.

**Window Management:**
Rectangle. Open-source, free, perfect. Snap windows with keyboard shortcuts like Windows. There's a paid version called Magnet for three dollars, but Rectangle is identical. Just use Rectangle.

**Menu Bar Management:**
Bartender. Hides menu bar icons you don't use constantly. Sixteen dollars a year. Worth it if menu bar chaos stresses you out.

Free alternative: Ice - brand new in 2025, works great. Or Hidden Bar.

**Screenshots:**
CleanShot X. Best screenshot tool for Mac. Annotations, scrolling screenshots, cloud upload, screen recording. Twenty-nine dollars a year.

For creators, this is essential. For casual users, the free app Shottr does annotations well.

**Browser:**
Arc. Spaces, vertical tabs, split view. Game changer if you're a tab hoarder like me. Still free right now. Get it before they add a paywall.

Free alternatives: Brave for privacy, Firefox for open-source.

**Password Manager:**
1Password. Family sharing, travel mode, security audits. Three dollars a month.

Free alternative: Bitwarden. Open-source, all core features. Both are excellent. Pick based on budget.

**Notes and Knowledge Base:**
Notion. Notes, databases, wikis, collaboration. Ten dollars a month if you use the paid features. Free tier works for most people.

Alternative: Obsidian - local files, powerful linking, free core features.

**Communication:**
Slack. Free for personal use, paid for team features. No real alternative if your team uses Slack.

**Calendar:**
Notion Calendar. Free, beautiful, integrates with Google Calendar and Notion databases. Just use this.

**Terminal:**
iTerm2 or Warp. Both free. iTerm2 is rock-solid classic. Warp has AI command suggestions. Pick your preference.

**Code Editor:**
VS Code. Free, open-source, industry standard. Extensions for everything. Unless you have a specific reason to use something else, just use VS Code.

**AI Coding Assistant:**
Claude Code. Twenty dollars a month. This is the only tool in this entire list where I'll say: it's absolutely worth paying for. Saves me 10 plus hours a month. Pays for itself immediately.

Free alternative: Continue.dev - open-source, but Claude Code is significantly better.

**System Monitor:**
Stats. Free, open-source, shows CPU, RAM, network in your menu bar. Beautiful design.

Paid alternative: iStat Menus for twelve dollars. Save your money. Stats is perfect.

**Package Manager:**
Homebrew. Free. Essential. Installs everything else via command line. You'll see why this matters in the automation section.

**Docker:**
Docker Desktop. Free for personal use. Essential if you're running containers locally.

**App Uninstaller:**
AppCleaner. Free. Removes apps and all their leftover files. The built-in macOS uninstaller leaves junk everywhere.

That's the full list. Now here's where it gets interesting."

**[VISUAL DIRECTION]:**
- 2:00-8:00: Screen recording showing each app briefly (5-10 seconds per app)
- Split layout: App on right 60%, you in corner bottom-left 40% (picture-in-picture)
- Quick cuts between apps (don't linger - this is a speed round)

**[ON-SCREEN TEXT for each app]:**
- App name (top)
- Price (below name)
- "Free alternative: [name]" (if applicable)
- Display for 3-5 seconds per app

**[B-ROLL - Pre-record these app demos]:**
- Raycast launching an app
- Rectangle snapping windows
- CleanShot X taking annotated screenshot
- Arc browser showing Spaces
- VS Code with extensions
- Stats showing system monitoring

**[PACING NOTE]:**
- Fast delivery - you're enumerating, not explaining deeply
- 15-20 seconds per app maximum
- Voice energy: Moderate-high (building momentum toward automation reveal)

### [8:00-10:00] INSTALLING CLAUDE CODE (2 minutes)

**SCRIPT:**
"Alright, now for the automation part.

Claude Code is Anthropic's AI coding assistant that runs in your terminal. Think GitHub Copilot, but it can actually execute commands, edit files, and configure your entire system.

Here's how to install it.

First, you need Node.js. If you don't have it, install Homebrew first, then:

```
brew install node
```

Then install Claude Code globally:

```
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

Takes about 30 seconds.

Once it's installed, authenticate:

```
claude
```

It'll open your browser, you sign in with your Anthropic account. If you don't have one, create it - there's a free tier to test this out.

Once you're authenticated, you're ready. This is where it gets wild."

**[VISUAL DIRECTION]:**
- 8:00-8:30: You talking, explaining what Claude Code is
- 8:30-10:00: Full-screen terminal recording
  - Show each command being typed
  - Show output in real-time
  - Clean terminal (no clutter)

**[ON-SCREEN TEXT]:**
- 8:05: "CLAUDE CODE = AI TERMINAL ASSISTANT"
- 8:35: Commands appear as overlays:
  - `brew install node`
  - `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`
  - `claude`

**[B-ROLL]:**
- Claude Code authentication screen
- Browser window showing Anthropic login
- Success message in terminal

**[PRODUCTION NOTE]:**
- Use screen recording software (CleanShot X or QuickTime)
- Clean terminal theme (readable contrast)
- Zoom in on terminal (text must be readable at 1080p)

---

### [10:00-14:00] AUTOMATION DEMO #1 - Installing Apps via Homebrew (4 minutes)

**SCRIPT:**
"Now watch this.

Instead of manually installing each app by downloading DMG files and dragging to Applications, I'm going to ask Claude Code to do it.

Here's my prompt:

```
Install these apps via Homebrew:
- Raycast, Rectangle, Stats, Bartender
- Arc browser, iTerm2, VS Code
- Slack, Notion, CleanShot X
- Docker Desktop, 1Password

Show me the commands you'll run before executing.
```

Watch what happens."

**[PAUSE - Show Claude Code thinking and responding]**

"Claude Code analyzed my request. It's telling me:

'I'll install these using Homebrew cask. Here are the commands I'll run:

```
brew install --cask raycast rectangle stats bartender-4
brew install --cask arc iterm2 visual-studio-code
brew install --cask slack notion cleanshot
brew install --cask docker 1password
```

Should I proceed?'

I type yes.

And now it's executing. Look at this."

**[PAUSE - Show installation progress]**

"Raycast... installed.
Rectangle... installed.
Stats... installed.

All of them. One prompt. Five minutes.

The manual way? You'd visit each app's website, download the DMG, drag to Applications, open the app, give it permissions, configure settings. Thirty apps times five minutes each? Two and a half hours minimum.

Claude Code just did it in five minutes while I got coffee.

But it gets better."

**[VISUAL DIRECTION]:**
- 10:00-10:45: You talking, showing the prompt
- 10:45-11:30: Split screen:
  - Left: Claude Code terminal response
  - Right: You reading it, explaining
- 11:30-14:00: Full-screen terminal
  - Show installation progress in real-time (or sped up 2x)
  - Each app installation appearing
  - Progress indicators

**[ON-SCREEN TEXT]:**
- 10:20: Prompt appears on screen (large, readable)
- 11:45: "INSTALLING..." progress indicator
- 12:30: Checklist appears:
  - ‚úì Raycast
  - ‚úì Rectangle
  - ‚úì Stats
  - (etc. - updating in real-time)

**[B-ROLL]:**
- Quick cuts showing each installed app opening for first time
- System permission dialogs appearing
- Apps appearing in Applications folder

**[PRODUCTION TIP]:**
- Speed up terminal footage to 1.5-2x if installation takes too long
- Keep your voice-over normal speed
- Show enough to prove it's real, not so much it drags

### [14:00-17:00] AUTOMATION DEMO #2 - Terminal & Dotfiles Setup (3 minutes)

**SCRIPT:**
"Okay, apps are installed. Now let's configure the terminal.

I use Zsh with Oh My Zsh, custom aliases, syntax highlighting, and NVM for Node.js version management.

Normally I'd copy my dotfiles from my old Mac, manually edit the .zshrc file, source it, debug any errors.

Here's what I tell Claude Code:

```
Set up my .zshrc file with:
- Oh My Zsh installation
- Plugins: git, nvm, docker, zsh-autosuggestions, zsh-syntax-highlighting
- Aliases:
  gs='git status'
  gp='git push'
  gc='git commit -m'
  gd='git diff'
- NVM initialization
- Custom prompt showing git branch

Create the file and source it.
```

Claude Code installs Oh My Zsh, creates the .zshrc file, adds all my aliases, initializes NVM.

Done in two minutes.

Let me show you the result."

**[PAUSE - Show terminal with new setup]**

"Look at this. Custom prompt showing my git branch. I type 'gs' - it runs git status. That's my alias working.

All configured automatically.

The manual way? You'd be editing config files, looking up syntax, fixing errors for thirty minutes minimum.

Claude Code did it in two."

- 14:05: "DOTFILES = YOUR TERMINAL CONFIG"
- 15:20: Prompt text overlay (large, readable)
- 16:35: "TESTING ALIASES..." then show each working

**[B-ROLL]:**
- Before/after terminal comparison
- Syntax highlighting demo
- Git branch showing in prompt
- Aliases executing

---

### [17:00-20:00] AUTOMATION DEMO #3 - Full Dev Environment (3 minutes)

**SCRIPT:**
"Alright, terminal is configured. Now let's set up the entire development environment.

Git configuration, SSH keys, Node.js, global packages, VS Code extensions, project directories.

Normally this is where I'd spend another hour. Different commands, different configs, lots of manual steps.

Here's my prompt to Claude Code:

```
Set up my development environment:

1. Configure Git:
   - Name: Sid Dani
   - Email: [your-email]
   - Default editor: VS Code
   - Default branch: main

2. Generate SSH key and display public key so I can add to GitHub

3. Install Node.js LTS via nvm

4. Install global npm packages: vercel, pnpm, tsx, typescript, eslint

5. Create ~/Dev/personal and ~/Dev/work directories

6. Install these VS Code extensions:
   - ESLint, Prettier, GitLens
   - ES7 React snippets
   - Tailwind CSS IntelliSense
   - GitHub Copilot
```

Watch."

**[PAUSE - Show execution]**

"Git configured. SSH key generated - there's my public key, I'm copying it to GitHub.

Node.js installing via NVM. Global packages installing.

Directories created. VS Code extensions installing.

Everything done in eight minutes.

My Mac is now production-ready. From zero to deployed app capability in thirty minutes total.

That's the power of automation."

**[VISUAL DIRECTION]:**
- 17:00-17:30: You explaining the scope

### [20:00-22:00] MANUAL VS AI COMPARISON - Split Screen (2 minutes)

**SCRIPT:**
"Let me put this in perspective.

I timed both approaches on identical Macs.

Manual setup:
- Installing apps: One hour twenty minutes
- Terminal configuration: Thirty-five minutes
- Dev environment: One hour ten minutes
- Total: Three hours five minutes

That's not counting mistakes, forgotten steps, or troubleshooting.

Claude Code automation:
- Installing apps: Five minutes
- Terminal configuration: Two minutes
- Dev environment: Eight minutes
- Total: Twenty-eight minutes

That's an eighty-five percent time reduction.

Same result. Same apps. Same configuration.

The only difference: I wrote prompts instead of clicking buttons.

And here's the thing - the automation is repeatable. You do this once, save your prompts, and every future Mac setup takes thirty minutes. New work laptop? Thirty minutes. Computer crashes? Thirty minutes. Helping a friend set up their Mac? Give them your prompts."

**[VISUAL DIRECTION]:**
- 20:00-22:00: Full split-screen comparison
  - Left side: Timelapse of manual setup (sped up)
  - Right side: Claude Code automation (real-time or slightly sped up)
  - Timer overlay on each side

**[ON-SCREEN TEXT]:**
- Large comparison graphic:
  ```
  MANUAL: 3h 5min
  CLAUDE CODE: 28min

  TIME SAVED: 85%
  ```

**[VISUAL EFFECTS]:**
- Progress bars racing (manual vs AI)
- Checkmarks appearing faster on Claude Code side
- Final time comparison emphasized

---

### [22:00-24:00] PRO TIPS - Saving Your Setup (2 minutes)

**SCRIPT:**
"Three pro tips before we wrap up.

**One:** Save your setup as a script.

Create a text file with all your Claude Code prompts in order. Save it to a GitHub Gist or a private repo. Next time you need to set up a Mac, just copy-paste each prompt. You're done.

I've linked my setup script in the description. Fork it, customize it for your apps.

**Two:** Automate system preferences too.

Claude Code can run macOS defaults commands. Things like:
- Hide the Dock: `defaults write com.apple.dock autohide -bool true`
- Show hidden files: `defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles true`
- Faster key repeat: `defaults write NSGlobalDomain KeyRepeat -int 1`

You can automate these too. Tell Claude: 'Configure my system preferences' and give it the list.

**Three:** Backup strategy.

Even with automation, back up your important files. Use Time Machine for local backups. iCloud for documents. GitHub for code and dotfiles.

Automation makes setup fast, but backups make sure you never lose anything."

**[VISUAL DIRECTION]:**
- 22:00-22:30: You talking to camera
- 22:30-23:15: Screen recording - showing GitHub Gist with saved prompts
- 23:15-23:45: Terminal showing system preferences commands
- 23:45-24:00: Backup apps/services (Time Machine, iCloud, GitHub logos)

**[ON-SCREEN TEXT]:**
- 22:05: "PRO TIP #1: SAVE YOUR PROMPTS"
- 22:50: "PRO TIP #2: AUTOMATE SYSTEM SETTINGS"
- 23:25: "PRO TIP #3: ALWAYS BACKUP"

**[B-ROLL]:**
- GitHub Gist interface

### Music/Audio Recommendations

**Background Music:**
- **Track style:** Upbeat, tech-focused, non-distracting
- **Genre:** Electronic, lo-fi, ambient tech
- **Tempo:** 100-120 BPM (moderate energy)
- **Sources:**
  - YouTube Audio Library: "Technology" category
  - Epidemic Sound: "Tech" playlists
  - Artlist: "Corporate & Technology"

**Music Timing:**
- 0:00-0:30: No music (clean hook)
- 0:30-2:00: Intro music (builds anticipation)
- 2:00-8:00: Light background (70% volume during app tour)
- 8:00-20:00: Minimal music (terminal work = focus on audio clarity)
- 20:00-22:00: Music returns (split-screen comparison)
- 22:00-25:00: Outro music (upbeat close)

**Audio Tips:**
- Voice is primary (music at 15-25% volume max)
- Duck music when you're talking (auto-duck in most editors)
- No music during terminal demos (clarity is key)

---

### Filming Setup

**Camera:**
- **Option 1:** iPhone 13+ (4K 60fps is plenty)
- **Option 2:** Webcam for talking head (Logitech C920 or better)
- **Screen recording:** CleanShot X or QuickTime (1080p minimum)

**Lighting:**
- Natural window light OR ring light
- Face should be well-lit (no shadows)
- Avoid backlighting (you'll be silhouette)

**Audio:**
- **Best:** External mic (Blue Yeti, Rode, or similar)
- **Good enough:** AirPods Pro in quiet room
- **Avoid:** Built-in Mac mic (sounds distant)

**Framing (talking head shots):**
- Center frame or slightly off-center
- Eyes at top-third of frame
- Clean background (not cluttered)
- Room for text overlays (keep to sides)

---

## Hook Variants (For A/B Testing)

### Original Hook (Recommended):
"I just got a new Mac. Setting it up used to take me 4 hours. Watch me do it in 30 minutes using AI."

"This Mac set itself up. I wrote three prompts. Watch what happened."
- **Why:** More curiosity-driven, mysterious angle
- **Best for:** Audiences who like tech magic reveals

### Variant 2 (Number Hook):
"Manual Mac setup: 4 hours. AI-automated setup: 30 minutes. Here's how."
- **Why:** Direct time-saving claim, clear value
- **Best for:** Efficiency-focused viewers

### Variant 3 (Question Hook):
"What if your Mac could configure itself while you got coffee? Let me show you."
- **Why:** Aspirational, paints a picture
- **Best for:** Lifestyle/productivity angle

**Testing Strategy:**
- Create 3 versions of the video with different hooks (first 5 seconds only)
- Upload as unlisted, send to small group
- Check retention at 0:30 mark (which hook holds viewers)

**Secondary Keywords:** "best Mac apps", "Mac automation", "Claude Code"

**Title optimization:**

- Curiosity element: ‚úì ("AI Does It For You")
- Under 60 characters: ‚úó (66 chars - acceptable, fits mobile)

**Description optimization:**
- First 150 chars have keywords (visible before "show more")
- Links above fold: GitHub Gist, app list
- Timestamps included (YouTube may auto-chapter)
- Hashtags at bottom (3-5 max)

**Transcript:**

- YouTube auto-caption is good, but manual upload is better
- Include timestamps in transcript
