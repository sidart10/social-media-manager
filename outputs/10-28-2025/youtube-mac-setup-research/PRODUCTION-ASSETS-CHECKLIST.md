**Scene 2: Intro (0:05-2:00)**
- [ ] Explaining the vision (casual, building excitement)
- [ ] Gestures: Open, inviting (not stiff)
- [ ] 2-3 takes for energy variation

**Scene 3: Teaching Segments (scattered throughout)**

---

## üì± RETENTION-SPECIFIC ASSETS (From Best Practices)

### Pattern Interrupt Elements (Every 45-60 seconds)

**Based on your script timing:**
- 0:45: Quick montage (apps/files/email) - VISUAL break
- 2:30: Terminal appears (switch from talking head) - FORMAT break
- 4:45: MCP diagram animation - GRAPHIC break
- 6:30: Config file view - CONTENT break
- 9:00: Split screen (terminal + Applications folder) - LAYOUT break
- 12:00: Agent file creation - NEW TOPIC break
- 15:00: B-roll montage (coffee making) - LIFESTYLE break
- 18:30: Morning briefing demo - PAYOFF break
- 21:30: Philosophical vision - TONE break
- 24:00: GitHub Gist screenshot - ACTIONABLE break

**Asset needed:** Variety in visuals (talking head, terminal, graphics, B-roll, split-screen)

### 50-60% Surprise Element (12-15 min mark)

**Your script placement:** Morning routine agent demo (18:00)

**Why this works:**
- Most surprising part (AI briefing you while you make coffee)
- Emotional payoff (viewers see real time savings)
- Re-engages viewers considering dropping off

**Asset needed:**
- Coffee-making B-roll (cinematic, satisfying)
- Real AI summaries generating (not fake/rushed)
- Your genuine reaction (this actually works)

### Hook Engineering (0:00-0:30)

**From best practices: "85% lose 50% of viewers in first 30s"**

**Your hook strategy:**
- 0:00-0:05: Bold claim (lowercase, direct)
- 0:05-0:30: Quick proof (montage of automation working)

**Assets needed:**
- Strong hook delivery (2-3 takes, pick best)
- Fast-paced montage footage (apps, files, summaries - quick cuts)
- Energy in delivery (confident, matter-of-fact)

## üéØ CRITICAL ASSETS (Must-Have for Script to Work)

**Without these, the video doesn't work:**

1. **Working Claude Code installation** ‚úÖ (you have this)
2. **MCP servers actually installed and configured** ‚úÖ (you can do this)
3. **Agent file created** (placeholder is fine - doesn't need to actually execute)
4. **Skill files created** (placeholders fine - visual demo only)
5. **Morning routine demo footage** - This MUST look real:
   - Show the command being typed
   - Show plausible output (can be pre-written and cat'd to terminal if needed)
   - Your genuine reaction

**Assets you can fake/simulate (if needed):**
- Email summaries (create realistic terminal output, display it)
- Slack summaries (same - pre-write the output format)
- Calendar briefing (realistic example output)

**Assets you CANNOT fake:**
- App installation via Homebrew (must be real - but you can speed up)
- MCP installation (must show real npm installs)
- Claude Code authentication (must be real)
- File/folder creation (must be real Finder footage)

- CTR (click-through rate from impressions: target 4-8%)
- Retention at 0:30 (target: 50%+ still watching)
- Retention at end (target: 35-45%)

**First Week:**
