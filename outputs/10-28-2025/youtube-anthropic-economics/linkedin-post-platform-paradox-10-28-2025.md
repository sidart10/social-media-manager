## FINAL POST

Anthropic claims to be "platform-first" while launching Claude.ai, Claude Code, Claude for Excel, and Claude for Financial Services.

Platform company or application company?

The answer: strategically both. And Dario Amodei's explanation from the Stripe podcast reveals one of the smartest frameworks I've encountered for platform strategy.

Here's what's actually happening:

THE FOUNDATION: CLAUDE.AI CAME FIRST

Before building a developer platform, Anthropic launched Claude.ai—a consumer chatbot competing directly with ChatGPT. This wasn't a platform play. It was a product.

This established the pattern: build first-party applications to understand how users actually interact with the model. Then feed those insights back to improve the API for the entire ecosystem.

THE VERTICAL EXPANSION: WHY CLAUDE CODE EXISTS

February 2025. Anthropic launches Claude Code—their first developer-focused vertical application.

This raised questions: Why would a "platform company" build a coding tool when Cursor, Windsurf, and dozens of ecosystem partners were already building on their API?

Dario's answer from the Stripe podcast: "The people who write code are very socially and technically adjacent to the folks who develop AI models."

Translation: developers adopt new technology in hours. Enterprises take years.

Claude Code wasn't just a product launch. It was a strategic testing ground—the fastest possible feedback loop for understanding what the model needs to deliver.

Results: $500M+ in annual revenue, 10x user growth since May 2025.

THE FRAMEWORK: THREE REASONS TO BUILD FIRST-PARTY APPS

Dario provided John Collison with three explicit reasons why platform companies should selectively build applications:

Reason 1: Direct User Exposure

"The end user gives you some sense of how exactly are they using it, what are they most looking for. If you're a pure platform and you don't have that direct connection, you can be disadvantaged."

Without observing how users actually interact with your model, you lack the insights needed to prioritize improvements. The API abstracts away crucial user behavior patterns.

Reason 2: Model Improvement Insights

"It may even be hard to know where the model really, really needs to go. There are many models that seem to be good at coding, but they aren't good in the way that's actually relevant."

Building Claude Code taught Anthropic what "good at coding" means in practice—not benchmark performance, but real developer workflows and pain points.

Reason 3: Enterprise Ease-of-Use

Traditional enterprises struggle to build on APIs. They need pre-built solutions or implementation kits to get started. First-party applications lower the barrier to entry for slower-moving but higher-value enterprise customers.

THE REAL EXAMPLE: CLAUDE FOR EXCEL

October 2025. Anthropic launches Claude for Excel with 1,000 beta users.

This is particularly interesting because multiple companies are already building spreadsheet AI tools on Claude's API. Anthropic is now competing with their own ecosystem partners.

The strategic play: Excel integration provides direct access to how financial analysts, accountants, and business users actually work with AI. These insights feed back into improving Claude's platform for ALL financial use cases—including those built by ecosystem partners.

This isn't zero-sum competition. It's strategic ecosystem positioning.

THE HISTORICAL PRECEDENT: AWS DEMONSTRATED THIS

Dario compared Anthropic's strategy to cloud infrastructure companies. AWS provides the definitive example.

AWS built SageMaker (machine learning platform), Lambda (serverless compute), and dozens of vertical services—while simultaneously being the dominant infrastructure platform.

Did this destroy their ecosystem? No. It strengthened the ecosystem because AWS developed deeper customer understanding, which improved the underlying platform.

The pattern: Build sufficient first-party applications to understand user behavior deeply. Apply those insights to improve the platform. The ecosystem benefits because the platform evolves based on real usage patterns.

THE COUNTERARGUMENT: PURE PLATFORM STRATEGY HAS RISKS

Dario's most provocative insight: "If you're a pure platform and you don't have that direct connection, you can be disadvantaged in various ways. It's hard to build the best products."

Pure platform companies lose the feedback signal that informs product development priorities.

They're making decisions based on support tickets and feature requests rather than observing actual usage patterns. This creates a fundamental information gap.

This is why Anthropic will continue building selective first-party applications. Not to capture all ecosystem value, but because they need direct observation of how people use Claude to make the platform better for everyone.

THE ANTHROPIC DOCTRINE

Here's the strategic framework:

Platform-first strategy doesn't mean platform-only execution.

Build first-party apps when:
• You need direct user exposure to improve the core product
• The vertical has fast adoption velocity (ideal testing ground)
• The enterprise market requires pre-built solutions (friction reduction)

Maintain platform focus when:
• Ecosystem partners can reach markets you can't
• Ecosystem innovation exceeds internal capability
• The use case doesn't provide unique model improvement insights

Anthropic's approach: Platform-first in strategic mindset, but selectively application-present in tactical execution.

Use first-party applications as "sensors" that make your platform more intelligent. Feed those insights back into the API. Create a compounding flywheel.

This is how you compete when OpenAI builds ChatGPT plugins, Google builds Workspace integrations, and Meta builds consumer applications.

Not by being purely platform OR purely application. By being strategically both.

The companies that master this balance will define the AI platform era.
