    "text": "Anthropic keeps saying they're \"platform-first\" while launching Claude.ai, Claude Code, Claude for Excel, Claude for Financial Services.\n\nSo which is it? Platform or application company?\n\nTurns out: both. And Dario Amodei's explanation of WHY reveals one of the smartest strategic frameworks I've seen.\n\nHere's what's actually happening:\n\nTHE FOUNDATION: CLAUDE.AI CAME FIRST\n\nBefore building anything else, Anthropic launched Claude.ai—a consumer chatbot competing directly with ChatGPT. Not a platform play. A product.\n\nThis set the pattern: build first-party applications to understand how people actually use the model. Then use those insights to make the API better for everyone.\n\nTHE VERTICAL EXPANSION: WHY CLAUDE CODE EXISTS\n\nFebruary 2025. Anthropic launches Claude Code—their first developer-focused vertical. This seemed weird. Why would a \"platform company\" build a coding tool when Cursor, Windsurf, and dozens of others were already building on their API?\n\nDario's answer from the Stripe podcast: \"The people who write code are very socially and technically adjacent to the folks who develop AI models.\"\n\nTranslation: developers adopt new tech in 2 hours. Enterprises take 2 years.\n\nClaude Code wasn't just a product. It was a testing ground. The fastest possible feedback loop for understanding what the model needs to do.\n\nAnd it worked. Claude Code now generates $500M+ in annual revenue and grew 10x since May 2025.\n\nTHE FRAMEWORK: THREE REASONS TO BUILD FIRST-PARTY APPS\n\nDario gave John Collison three explicit reasons why platform companies should selectively build applications:\n\nReason 1: Direct User Exposure\n\nQuote: \"The end user gives you some sense of how exactly are they using it, what are they most looking for. If you're a pure platform and you don't have that direct connection, you can be disadvantaged.\"\n\nWithout seeing how users actually interact with your model, you don't know where to improve it. The API abstracts away the user behavior.\n\nReason 2: Model Improvement Insights\n\nQuote: \"It may even be hard to know where the model really, really needs to go. There are many models that seem to be good at coding, but they aren't good in the way that's actually relevant.\"\n\nBuilding Claude Code taught them what \"good at coding\" actually means in practice. Not benchmark scores. Real developer workflows.\n\nReason 3: Enterprise Ease-of-Use\n\nTraditional companies struggle to build on APIs. They need pre-built solutions or kits to get started. First-party apps lower the barrier to entry for slower-moving but higher-value customers.\n\nTHE REAL EXAMPLE: CLAUDE FOR EXCEL\n\nOctober 2025. Anthropic launches Claude for Excel with 1,000 beta users.\n\nThis is fascinating because there are already companies building spreadsheet AI tools on Claude's API. Anthropic is now competing with their own ecosystem partners.\n\nBut here's the play: Excel integration gives them access to how financial analysts, accountants, and business users actually work with AI. That data feeds back into making Claude's platform better for ALL financial use cases—including the ones built by ecosystem partners.\n\nIt's not zero-sum competition. It's strategic ecosystem positioning.\n\nTHE HISTORICAL PRECEDENT: AWS DID THIS\n\nDario compared Anthropic to cloud companies. AWS is the perfect example.\n\nAWS built SageMaker (machine learning platform), Lambda (serverless compute), dozens of vertical services—all while being the dominant infrastructure platform.\n\nDid this kill their ecosystem? No. It made the ecosystem stronger because AWS understood customer needs better.\n\nThe pattern: Build enough first-party apps to understand user behavior deeply. Use those insights to improve the platform. The ecosystem wins because the platform gets better.\n\nTHE COUNTERARGUMENT: PURE PLATFORM IS A TRAP\n\nHere's Dario's most provocative point: \"If you're a pure platform and you don't have that direct connection, you can be disadvantaged in various ways. It's hard to build the best products.\"\n\nPure platform companies lose the feedback signal that tells them what to build next.\n\nThey're flying blind. Making guesses about what developers need based on support tickets and feature requests instead of watching real usage patterns.\n\nThis is why Anthropic will keep building selective first-party apps. Not to capture all the value from their ecosystem. Because they NEED to see how people actually use Claude to make the platform better for everyone.\n\nTHE ANTHROPIC DOCTRINE\n\nSo here's the framework:\n\nPlatform-first strategy doesn't mean platform-only execution.\n\nBuild first-party apps when:\n1. You need direct user exposure to improve the core product\n2. The vertical has fast adoption velocity (perfect testing ground)\n3. The enterprise market needs pre-built solutions (lower friction)\n\nKeep building the platform when:\n1. Partners can reach markets you can't\n2. Ecosystem innovation exceeds what you could build internally\n3. The use case doesn't provide unique model improvement insights\n\nAnthropic's play: Be platform-first in mindset, but strategically application-present in execution.\n\nUse first-party apps as \"sensors\" that make your platform smarter. Feed those insights back into the API. Create a flywheel.\n\nThis is how you compete with OpenAI (who's building ChatGPT plugins), Google (who's building Workspace integrations), and Meta (who's building consumer apps).\n\nNot by being purely platform OR purely application. By being strategically both.\n\nThe companies that figure this out will win the AI platform wars.\n\nSource: Stripe \"Cheeky Pint\" podcast with Dario Amodei (Aug 2025).
