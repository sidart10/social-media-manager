Anthropic claims to be "platform-first" while launching Claude.ai, Claude Code, Claude for Excel, and Claude for Financial Services.

Platform company or application company?

Both. And Dario Amodei's explanation reveals one of the smartest strategic frameworks I've encountered.

THE FOUNDATION: CLAUDE.AI CAME FIRST

Anthropic launched Claude.ai—a consumer chatbot competing with ChatGPT. Not a platform play. A product.

This established the pattern: build first-party apps to understand how users actually use the model, then feed insights back to improve the API for the ecosystem.

WHY CLAUDE CODE EXISTS

February 2025. Anthropic launches Claude Code—their first developer vertical.

Dario's answer: "The people who write code are very socially and technically adjacent to the folks who develop AI models."

Translation: developers adopt in hours. Enterprises take years.

Results: $500M+ annual revenue, 10x growth since May 2025.

THE FRAMEWORK: THREE REASONS TO BUILD FIRST-PARTY APPS

Reason 1: Direct User Exposure

"The end user gives you some sense of how they're using it, what they're looking for. If you're a pure platform without that connection, you can be disadvantaged."

Without seeing how users interact with your model, you don't know where to improve it. The API abstracts away user behavior.

Reason 2: Model Improvement Insights

"It may be hard to know where the model really needs to go. Many models seem good at coding, but they aren't good in the way that's actually relevant."

Claude Code taught them what "good at coding" means in practice—real workflows, not benchmarks.

Reason 3: Enterprise Ease-of-Use

Traditional enterprises struggle with APIs. First-party apps lower barriers for high-value customers.

CLAUDE FOR EXCEL: COMPETING WITH YOUR ECOSYSTEM

October 2025. Claude for Excel launches with 1,000 beta users.

Companies are building spreadsheet AI on Claude's API. Anthropic is competing with their own ecosystem.

The play: Excel reveals how analysts work with AI. Insights improve the platform for ALL use cases—including partner-built ones.

Strategic ecosystem positioning, not zero-sum competition.

THE DOCTRINE

Platform-first strategy doesn't mean platform-only execution.

Build first-party apps when:
• You need direct user exposure to improve the product
• The vertical has fast adoption velocity
• Enterprise needs pre-built solutions

Maintain platform focus when:
• Partners can reach markets you can't
• Ecosystem innovation exceeds internal capability
• The use case doesn't provide unique insights

Anthropic's approach: Platform-first in mindset, selectively application-present in execution.

Use first-party apps as "sensors" that make your platform smarter. Feed insights back to the API. Create a flywheel.

This is how you compete with OpenAI, Google, and Meta—not by being purely platform OR application, but strategically both.

AWS did this with SageMaker and Lambda. It strengthened their ecosystem because they understood customer needs better.

The companies that master this balance will define the AI platform era.
