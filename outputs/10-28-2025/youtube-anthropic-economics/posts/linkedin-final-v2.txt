Anthropic claims "platform-first" while launching Claude.ai, Claude Code, Claude for Excel, and Claude for Financial Services.

Platform or application company?

Both. Dario Amodei's explanation reveals one of the smartest strategic frameworks I've seen.

CLAUDE.AI CAME FIRST

Anthropic launched Claude.ai—a consumer chatbot competing with ChatGPT. Not a platform play. A product.

This established the pattern: build first-party apps to understand actual usage, then feed insights back to improve the API for the ecosystem.

WHY CLAUDE CODE EXISTS

February 2025. Anthropic launches Claude Code.

Dario: "People who write code are very socially and technically adjacent to folks who develop AI models."

Translation: developers adopt in hours. Enterprises take years.

Results: $500M+ revenue, 10x growth since May 2025.

THE FRAMEWORK

Dario gave three explicit reasons why platform companies should selectively build applications:

Reason 1: Direct User Exposure

"The end user gives you some sense of how they're using it. If you're a pure platform without that connection, you can be disadvantaged."

The API abstracts away user behavior. You need to see actual interaction patterns.

Reason 2: Model Improvement Insights

"It may be hard to know where the model really needs to go. Many models seem good at coding, but aren't good in the way that's actually relevant."

Claude Code taught them what "good at coding" means—real workflows, not benchmarks.

Reason 3: Enterprise Ease-of-Use

Traditional enterprises struggle with APIs. First-party apps lower barriers.

CLAUDE FOR EXCEL

October 2025. Claude for Excel launches with 1,000 beta users.

Companies already build spreadsheet AI on Claude's API. Anthropic competes with their own ecosystem.

The play: Excel reveals how analysts work with AI. Insights improve the platform for ALL cases—including partner-built ones.

Strategic ecosystem positioning.

THE DOCTRINE

Platform-first doesn't mean platform-only.

Build first-party apps when:
• You need user exposure to improve the product
• The vertical has fast adoption velocity
• Enterprise needs pre-built solutions

Maintain platform focus when:
• Partners can reach markets you can't
• Ecosystem innovation exceeds yours
• The use case doesn't provide unique insights

Use first-party apps as "sensors." Feed insights to the API. Create a flywheel.

AWS did this with SageMaker and Lambda—strengthening their ecosystem by understanding customers better.

This is how you compete with OpenAI, Google, Meta: be strategically both platform AND application.

The companies mastering this balance will define the AI platform era.
