- Emotional honesty ("deeply disappointing")
- Numbered action steps
- Example: Phone scam warning

---

## Argument Architecture Formula

**Your Structure:**
Bold Thesis → Intellectual Qualification → Systematic Proof → Reframed Close

**Example:**
1. **Thesis:** "Anthropic is the most confident company"
2. **Qualification:** "Don't get me wrong, other labs have figured things out..."
3. **Proof:** Era 1, Era 2, Era 3 framework with enumerated features
4. **Close:** "Anthropic is the biggest dark horse in the race"

---

## Debarghya Das Integration

**Patterns Blended:**
1. Sharper contrast irony ("Most X do Y but can't even Z")
2. Economic transparency (talk about costs/pricing)
3. Structural chiasmus ("X ≠ Y. Y ≠ X" reversals)
4. Industry in-jokes (calling out BS)
5. Cultural code-switching (selective Hindi for casual immigrant posts)

**Blending Strategy:**
- Keep core sid voice (forward momentum, frameworks, intellectual honesty)
- Enhance with Debarghya (sharper irony, economic clarity)
- Result: More punch while maintaining authenticity

---

## Mode Selection Decision Tree

```
Quick observation (< 150 chars)?
└─ CASUAL (lowercase, conversational)

Tech analysis (> 500 chars)?
└─ ANALYST (frameworks, enumeration, qualifiers)

Community/immigration issue?
└─ PROTECTOR (emotional honesty, action steps)

Satirizing hype?
└─ SATIRIST (hyperbole, escalation, deadpan)

Announcement/milestone?
└─ ENTHUSIAST (momentum, energy close)
```

## Confidence & Quality

**Current:** 7/10 confidence
- 12 authentic LinkedIn posts analyzed

## What /write-posts and /write-scripts Now Do

**Before v2.0:**
- Generic voice matching
- No mode awareness
- Basic pattern replication

**After v2.0:**
- Auto-selects voice mode based on content type
- Applies argument architecture formula
- Uses proof hierarchy (enumeration, specifics)
- Maintains closing patterns by mode
- Blends Debarghya's sharper contrasts
- Preserves emotional range

**Example:**
- Writing tech analysis → Auto-selects ANALYST mode → Uses frameworks + "Don't get me wrong" qualifiers + enumeration
- Writing quick take → Auto-selects CASUAL mode → Lowercase + conversational
- Writing community warning → Auto-selects PROTECTOR mode → "Heads-up" + emotional honesty + action steps
