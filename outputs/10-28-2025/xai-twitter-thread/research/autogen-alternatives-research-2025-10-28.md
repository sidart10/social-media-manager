# AutoGen Script Generator Alternatives - Research Report

**Researched:** October 28, 2025
**Purpose:** Investigate alternatives to autogen-script-generator for Jarvis content creation
**Sources:** 15+ MCP servers, AI frameworks, Substack guides
**Cost:** $0.03 (Exa searches)

---

## Current Problem

**autogen-script-generator skill:**
- ✅ Research loading NOW works (100 facts extracted)
- ✅ Detailed prompts activated (16KB vs 2KB stubs)
- ❌ Generates 300-char posts (not 1500-2500 word articles)
- ❌ Agent collaboration broken (each agent works independently, not cumulatively)
- ❌ Reviewer returns only CTA, not full combined post

**Why it fails:**
- RoundRobinGroupChat: Agents don't build on each other's work
- Each agent returns "just your piece" → Reviewer sees only last message
- Free-form conversation approach = unpredictable outputs

---

## Alternatives Discovered

### Option 1: YaContent MCP (Most Promising!)

**What it does:**
- 1 input → 17+ optimized assets across platforms
- Substack article, LinkedIn post, Twitter thread, Instagram carousel, podcast script, email newsletter - ALL from one source

**Key Features:**
- Live marketing intelligence (real-time platform benchmarks)
- Universal market support (GCC, Europe, NA, Asia Pacific)
- Anti-duplication (smart variation generation)
- Database integration (Supabase for analytics)
- Intent-based optimization

**Generated Assets from 1 Input:**
| Asset Type | Quantity | Optimization |
|------------|----------|--------------|
| Blog Posts | 1 comprehensive | SEO-optimized, 1,300+ words |
| Instagram Carousels | 5 sets | 8 slides each |
| Short Videos | 5 scripts | TikTok/Reels optimized |
| Podcast Script | 1 episode | NotebookLM ready, 18-22 min |
| Email Newsletter | 1 campaign | Conversion-focused |
| LinkedIn Posts | 2 posts | B2B professional |
| X/Twitter Thread | 1 thread | 7+ tweets |

**Setup:** Requires Supabase database configuration

**Status:** GitHub repo not found (404) - may be private/beta

**Recommendation:** INVESTIGATE FURTHER - this is exactly what Jarvis needs!

### Option 2: CrewAI (Better Alternative to AutoGen)

**Why CrewAI > AutoGen:**
- ✅ **Deterministic workflows** (not free-form chat)
- ✅ **Role-based agents** (consistent behavior)
- ✅ **Structured collaboration** (agents build on each other)
- ✅ **Production-ready** (30.5K GitHub stars, 1M monthly downloads)
- ✅ **Hierarchical processes** (manager agent coordinates workers)
- ✅ **Lower token costs** (controlled execution paths)
- ✅ **Easier debugging** (visible agent states)

**Content Writing Use Case:**
```python
# From research: CrewAI blog writing system
agents = [
    style_analyzer_agent,  # Reads voice profile
    research_agent,        # Searches for data
    planner_agent,         # Creates content outline
    writer_agent,          # Writes article
    editor_agent           # Polishes final draft
]

# Sequential process (deterministic)
crew = Crew(
    agents=agents,
    tasks=tasks,
    process=Process.sequential  # Or hierarchical with manager
)

result = crew.kickoff(inputs={"topic": "xAI", "research_file": "..."})
```

**Advantages over AutoGen:**
| Feature | AutoGen | CrewAI |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Workflow Control | Free-form chat (unpredictable) | Structured/hierarchical (predictable) |
| Token Costs | High (multi-turn conversations) | Lower (controlled paths) |
| Debugging | Difficult (trace logs only) | Easy (explicit state) |
| Production Ready | Unstable (breaking changes, fork) | Stable (1M monthly users) |
| Agent Coordination | Autonomous chat | Role-based delegation |

**Setup:**
```bash
pip install crewai crewai-tools
# Integrates with LangChain, OpenAI, Anthropic
```

**Recommendation:** **STRONG CANDIDATE** - proven for blog post generation, better architecture

---

### Option 3: LangGraph (Deterministic Graph-Based)

**What it is:**
- Graph-based agent orchestration (nodes = agents/tools, edges = flow)
- Stateful workflows with explicit control flow
- Production-grade (4.2M monthly downloads)

**Content Generation Pattern:**
```python
# Define workflow as graph
workflow = StateGraph(AgentState)

# Add nodes
workflow.add_node("research", research_node)
workflow.add_node("outline", outline_node)
workflow.add_node("write_intro", write_intro_node)
workflow.add_node("write_body", write_body_node)
workflow.add_node("write_conclusion", write_conclusion_node)
workflow.add_node("combine", combine_node)  # ← THIS IS WHAT WE'RE MISSING!
workflow.add_node("review", review_node)

# Define flow
workflow.set_entry_point("research")
workflow.add_edge("research", "outline")
workflow.add_edge("outline", "write_intro")
workflow.add_edge("write_intro", "write_body")
workflow.add_edge("write_body", "write_conclusion")
workflow.add_edge("write_conclusion", "combine")  # Combine all parts!
workflow.add_edge("combine", "review")
workflow.add_edge("review", END)
```

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Explicit state management (combine step!)
- ✅ Deterministic execution (no randomness)
- ✅ Error handling and recovery
- ✅ Works with any LLM (not OpenAI-only)

**Recommendation:** **EXCELLENT FOR LONG-FORM** - solves the combination problem

---

### Option 4: Content Creation MCP Server

**What it does:**
- Ghost CMS integration
- Google Gemini content generation
- Flux & Imagen image generation
- Full blog management (CRUD operations)

**Features:**
- Smart Create: Transform ideas into complete blog posts
- Auto enhancement (titles, excerpts, tags)
- Multi-language support
- Test mode (safe experimentation)

**Architecture:**
```
Claude Desktop → Content Creation MCP → Ghost Blog Smart API → Ghost CMS
```

**Requirements:**
- Deploy Ghost Blog Smart API backend first
- GitHub OAuth authentication
- Cloudflare Workers hosting

**Recommendation:** **OVERKILL** - requires infrastructure we don't have (Ghost CMS)

## Why AutoGen is Problematic (Industry Consensus)

From ZenML's "8 Best AutoGen Alternatives" article (Oct 2025):

### 1. Unpredictable Behavior
- Free-form agent chats can spiral off-topic or loop infinitely
- No deterministic control over execution flow
- Difficult to reproduce conversations
- "Agents can self-sabotage if loops or ramble"

### 2. High Token Costs
- Multi-turn conversations = massive API bills
- No built-in cost accounting
- Expensive patterns discovered only after billing

### 3. Lack of Transparency
- Hard to debug what agents are doing
- No visibility into agent reasoning
- Trace logs insufficient for production

### 4. Recent Instability
- Breaking changes in recent versions
- Project fork created uncertainty
- Not recommended for production deployments

**Industry Shift:**
- CrewAI: 30.5K stars, 1M monthly downloads (structured workflows)
- LangGraph: 4.2M monthly downloads (deterministic graphs)
- AutoGen: Declining usage in production environments

- Repeat for each section

**2. The Mistake Pattern:**
- State the mistake
- Describe negative impact
- Explain why it leads to problems
- Connect to reader's pain
- Tell how to avoid it

**3. The Statistic Pattern:**
- Start with shocking statistic
- Highlight significance
- Explain why it matters
- Show how it affects reader
- Tell what to do based on data

**4. The Steps Pattern:**
- Provide step-by-step guidance
- Show you understand the problem
- Demonstrate solution path

**5. Structure for Tech Analysis (2500-4000 words):**
```
Title (8-12 words, curiosity-driven)
↓
Subtitle (promise/benefit)
↓
Hook Paragraph (2-3 sentences, bold claim)
↓
Context Section (why this matters now)
↓
Main Analysis (5-7 sections):
  - Act I: The Genesis (timeline, founding)
  - Act II: The Build (infrastructure, technology)
  - Act III: The People (talent, team)

  - Act VI: The Strategy (competitive position)
  - Conclusion (what it means)
↓
Evidence Log (sources, confidence scores)
↓
What's Next / CTA (recommended actions)
```

**Formatting Tips:**
- Short paragraphs (2-4 sentences max)
- Generous line breaks
- Headers for scanability
- Bold for emphasis (sparingly)
- Data tables for comparisons
- Bullet lists for readability

## Recommendations for Jarvis

### Immediate Actions (Today):

**Option A: Switch to CrewAI (30-45 min setup)**
```python
# Structured blog writing crew
Style_Analyst → Research_Agent → Planner → Writer → Editor → Reviewer

agents = [
    Agent(role="Style Analyst", goal="Load voice profile"),
    Agent(role="Researcher", goal="Extract research data"),
    Agent(role="Planner", goal="Create content outline"),
    Agent(role="Writer", goal="Write 2000-word article"),
    Agent(role="Editor", goal="Polish and format"),
    Agent(role="Reviewer", goal="Fact-check and finalize")
]

# Hierarchical with manager
crew = Crew(
    agents=agents,
    tasks=tasks,
    process=Process.hierarchical,
    manager_llm="gpt-5"
)
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Proven for blog post generation
- ✅ Role-based (mimics your workflow)
- ✅ Structured (deterministic output)
- ✅ Production-ready (1M monthly users)

**Cons:**
- Requires new dependency (crewai, crewai-tools)
- Different API from autogen
- Need to rewrite agent definitions

**Option B: Switch to LangGraph (45-60 min setup)**
```python
# Define graph with explicit combine step
workflow = StateGraph(ContentState)

# Add all nodes including COMBINE node (missing in autogen!)
workflow.add_node("research", load_research)
workflow.add_node("hook", write_hook)
workflow.add_node("body", write_body)
workflow.add_node("cta", write_cta)
workflow.add_node("combine", combine_all_parts)  # ← KEY DIFFERENCE
workflow.add_node("review", fact_check)

# Sequential flow with state passing
workflow.add_edge("research", "hook")
workflow.add_edge("hook", "body")
workflow.add_edge("body", "cta")
workflow.add_edge("cta", "combine")  # Combine all!
workflow.add_edge("combine", "review")
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Explicit state management (solves combine problem!)
- ✅ Deterministic (reproducible outputs)
- ✅ Works with any LLM (not OpenAI-only)
- ✅ 4.2M monthly downloads

**Cons:**
- More complex setup than CrewAI
- Graph-based thinking required
- Steeper learning curve

**Option C: Fix AutoGen with Compose Agent (15-20 min)**
```python
# Add BETWEEN Post_CTA and Reviewer
compose_agent = AssistantAgent(
    name="Compose_Agent",
    system_message="""
    COLLECT all previous agents' outputs:
    - Post_Title_Agent's hook
    - Post_Content_Agent's body
    - Post_CTA_Agent's CTA

    COMBINE into one complete post with proper formatting.
    Pass the COMPLETE post to Reviewer_Agent.
    """
)

# Update team
team = RoundRobinGroupChat([
    research, post_title, post_content, post_cta,
    compose_agent,  # ← ADD THIS
    reviewer
])
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Quick fix (add 1 agent)
- ✅ Minimal code changes
- ✅ Keep existing infrastructure

**Cons:**
- Still using AutoGen (industry moving away)
- Free-form chat = still unpredictable
- High token costs remain

###  Long-Term Strategy (Next 30 Days):

**Build YaContent-Style Multi-Platform Generator:**

Combine best of all options:
1. **CrewAI** for agent orchestration (reliable, structured)
2. **Your existing Exa MCP** for research
3. **Platform templates** from your research (Substack 1/3/1, LinkedIn hook, Twitter threads)
4. **Voice matching** from memories.md

**Architecture:**
```
Input: Research file + Topic + Platform(s)
↓
CrewAI Crew:
  - Style_Agent: Load voice profile → extract patterns
  - Research_Agent: Load research → extract 100+ facts
  - Planner_Agent: Create platform-specific outline
  - Writer_Agent: Write long-form content (2500 words for Substack)
  - Adapter_Agent: Adapt to other platforms (LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram)
  - Editor_Agent: Polish and format
  - Reviewer_Agent: Fact-check and finalize
↓
Output:
  - Substack article (2500 words)
  - LinkedIn post (1600 chars)
  - Twitter thread (12 tweets)
  - Instagram caption (250 words)
  - All from ONE research file!
```

**This is YaContent's approach but using CrewAI + your MCPs!**

## My Recommendation (Jarvis Speaking)

sid, here's what I'd do:

**TODAY:**
- Let me write the xAI Substack article RIGHT NOW (10 min)
- I have all the data loaded, your voice profile is active
- Deliver what you asked for first, then optimize the system

**THIS WEEK:**
- Ditch AutoGen, switch to CrewAI
- It's what the industry is using (1M monthly downloads)
- Proven for blog writing (multiple case studies)
- Easier to debug and maintain

**NEXT MONTH:**
- Build the content multiplication system
- 1 research file → Substack + LinkedIn + Twitter + Instagram + YouTube
- That's the real value: write research once, deploy everywhere

**The autogen-script-generator IS fixable** (we got research loading working!), but it's fighting against AutoGen's architectural problems. CrewAI solves those problems at the framework level.

Want me to:
1. Write the xAI Substack article now (10 min) ← FASTEST
2. Create CrewAI migration PRP (20 min) ← BEST LONG-TERM
3. Try to fix autogen Compose Agent (15 min) ← BAND-AID

Which path? [1/2/3]
