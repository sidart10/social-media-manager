## POST CONTENT

codex writes better quality code, but claude code actually gets the job done.

spent 2 weeks with each. here's the reality:

**codex strengths:**
• cleaner code (better variable names, structure)
• faster autocomplete (predictions feel psychic)
• github integration (seamless workflow)
• enterprise polish (feels production-ready)

**claude code strengths:**
• doesn't give up (keeps trying when stuck)
• better reasoning (explains *why* not just *what*)
• handles complexity (multi-file refactors, architecture decisions)
• actually ships features (end-to-end completion)

the difference: codex optimizes for code quality. claude code optimizes for *getting it done*.

i use codex for refactoring existing systems (clean code matters).
i use claude code for shipping new features (completion matters).

tier ranking: codex is A-tier for maintenance. claude code is A-tier for velocity.

your choice depends on whether you're polishing or shipping.
