# Production Guide: The Distance Between

**Format:** Studio Ghibli-style animated film without dialogue
**Total Runtime:** 12-15 minutes (expandable to 20-30 for feature short)
**Scenes:** 18 core scenes (8 seconds each base, some extended)
**Generation Tool:** Veo3 (Google) for cinematic quality and Ghibli aesthetic

---

## Quick Start: Generate All Scenes

### Option 1: Generate All 18 Scenes Sequentially

Use the provided `complete-video-prompts.json` file with AI Video Agent:

```bash
# Navigate to AI Video Agent
/ai-video-agent

# Select: *create-scene-batch
# Provide: complete-video-prompts.json
# Output: outputs/10-31-2025/the-distance-between-father-son/scenes/
```

### Option 2: Generate Key Scenes First (Proof of Concept)

**Priority Scenes for Demo Reel:**
1. Scene 1 - Morning kitchen (establishes warmth)
2. Scene 7 - Train station wave (establishes distance)
3. Scene 15 - Hands working together (emotional peak)
4. Scene 18 - Birdhouse reveal (resolution)

Generate these 4 first to validate aesthetic before committing to full production.

---

## Scene-by-Scene Generation Instructions

Each scene in `complete-video-prompts.json` follows Emily's proven structure. To generate individual scenes:

### Using Veo3 Directly:

```bash
# For each scene, extract the prompt structure and generate:

veo generate \
  --prompt "[scene.visual_details combined with scene.subject and scene.scene]" \
  --model veo-3.0-generate \
  --aspect-ratio 16:9 \
  --duration 8
```

### Example - Scene 1 Full Prompt:

```
Close-up to medium close-up intimate kitchen moment.
Slow 30cm dolly-in on hands then tilt-up to reveal father and son.
50mm spherical T2.8 for intimate warmth shallow DOF.

Subject: Father's large weathered hands cracking eggs into bowl, small boy's hands age 7 reaching up to help, spilling juice. Father gentle patient smile ruffles son's hair, boy looks up with wide admiring eyes.

Scene: Sunlit Japanese-style kitchen, wooden counters, traditional rice cooker, morning steam. Window casting warm rectangular light across counter, dust motes floating in sunbeams. Early morning golden hour 7am, clear sunny day, soft atmospheric glow.

Timeline:
0.0-2.5s: Focus tight on father's hands cracking eggs, bowl of rice visible, camera begins dolly-in, small hands enter frame reaching upward. Egg white drips naturally, chopsticks rest on bowl, rice steams gently.

2.5-5.0s: Boy's small hand accidentally tips juice glass, father's large hand catches it mid-fall, both hands visible showing size contrast. Juice tilts with liquid physics, glass caught before spill.

5.0-8.0s: Camera completes dolly and tilts up, father ruffles son's hair, boy beams up at him, morning light halos both figures, hold on their connection. Hair moves naturally from touch, warm atmosphere, dust particles visible.

Cinematography: Warm golden hour lighting, key from window left, fill from white kitchen walls, rim from soft morning glow. Ghibli domestic warmth, naturalistic soft shadows. Grade with warm golden hour, pushed yellows, lifted shadows, gentle bloom on highlights.

Color palette: Primary #F4D03F (golden), Secondary #E67E22 (orange), Background #FDF6E3 (cream), Accent #935116 (brown).

Studio Ghibli aesthetic, anime-real naturalistic lighting, nostalgic atmospheric, emotional restraint, visual poetry.

## Music Composition Guide

### Four Musical Themes (Leitmotifs)

#### Theme 1: "Wonder" (Act 1)
**Instrumentation:** Warm strings, gentle piano, woodwinds
**Key:** G Major (warm, stable)
**Tempo:** 72 BPM (leisurely, childlike)
**Emotional Tone:** Safety, warmth, admiration, gentle teaching

**Key Moments:**
- Scene 1: Piano melody as eggs crack, warmth
- Scene 2: Strings swell when tool is passed
- Scene 3: Full theme as hands clasp in field

**Reference:** Studio Ghibli "My Neighbor Totoro" pastoral themes, Joe Hisaishi

---

#### Theme 2: "Fracture" (Act 2)
**Instrumentation:** Dissonant strings, harsh percussion, silence gaps
**Key:** D Minor (tension, conflict)
**Tempo:** Variable, 60-90 BPM unstable
**Emotional Tone:** Anger, rebellion, unspoken pain, distance growing

**Key Moments:**
- Scene 4: Silence when plate crashes, percussion stab
- Scene 5: Tense drone during dinner arc, clockwork percussion
- Scene 6: Strings build as father pauses, silence when he leaves doorway
- Scene 7: Melancholic transformation as wave happens, theme breaks

**Reference:** Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence (Ryuichi Sakamoto) - restrained emotional pain

---

#### Theme 3: "Distance" (Act 3)
**Instrumentation:** Solo cello, sparse piano, urban ambient pads
**Key:** E Minor (loneliness, longing)
**Tempo:** 55 BPM (slow, melancholic, time drags)
**Emotional Tone:** Isolation, urban loneliness, years passing, connection maintained but thin

**Key Moments:**
- Scene 8: Sparse piano as phone isn't answered, lone cello
- Scene 9: Dual themes layered (father's and son's) same melody different temperatures
- Scene 10: Phone call - melody wants to resolve, doesn't
- Scene 11: Time-lapse montage - theme cycles with seasons, aging

**Reference:** Arrival soundtrack (Jóhann Jóhannsson) - sparse emotional weight

---

#### Theme 4: "Return" (Act 4)
**Instrumentation:** Full orchestra, Act 1 theme returns but mature, complete
**Key:** G Major returns (full circle) but richer harmonies
**Tempo:** 68 BPM (slower than Act 1, earned peace)
**Emotional Tone:** Bittersweet, resolved, acceptance, mature love, completion

**Key Moments:**
- Scene 12: Sparse beginning, decision forming, hope entering
- Scene 13: Act 1 piano returns on train, nostalgic
- Scene 14: Strings swell at doorway crossing
- Scene 15: Full Theme 1 return in workshop, but deeper harmonies
- Scene 16: Peak orchestral moment, object passed, everything unspoken understood
- Scene 17: Theme builds to warmth, smiles, resolution
- Scene 18: Complete orchestral statement, Theme 1 fully mature, gentle fade

**Reference:** Up (Michael Giacchino) - wordless emotional storytelling, The Tale of Princess Kaguya (Joe Hisaishi) - bittersweet beauty

---

### Master Theme: "The Distance"

**Concept:** Single melodic line that transforms across all four acts

**Evolution:**
- Act 1: Major key, complete phrases, warm harmonies (connection)
- Act 2: Minor key, interrupted phrases, dissonance (fracture)
- Act 3: Sparse, lonely, incomplete (isolation)
- Act 4: Major key returns, full harmonies, complete phrases (resolution)

**Musical Arc:** The melody is the relationship - fracturing, surviving distance, completing itself

---

## Sound Design Notes (No Dialogue)

### Environmental Layers:

**Act 1 Sounds:**
- Kitchen: Rice cooker steam, eggs cracking, morning birds
- Workshop: Chisel on wood, sawdust settling, tools moving
- Field: Wind through grass, distant birds, footsteps on dirt

**Act 2 Sounds:**
- Plate crash (Scene 4): Sharp, shocking, silence after
- Dinner (Scene 5): Chopsticks on bowl, clock ticking, rain on window
- Room (Scene 6): Clothes folding, hallway footsteps fading
- Station (Scene 7): Train announcements (muffled), crowd ambience, departure bells

**Act 3 Sounds:**
- Apartment: Keyboard typing, city hum distant, phone buzzing
- Workshop: Same tools but quieter, lonelier, empty space
- Time passage: Seasonal shifts (rain, wind, silence, birds returning)

**Act 4 Sounds:**
- Return to Act 1 sounds (kitchen, workshop) but aged, familiar
- Tools working together (synchronized rhythm)
- Evening ambience (crickets, gentle wind, peaceful)
- Final scene: City sounds outside but peaceful inside

### Foley Focus: Hands

Every scene needs detailed hand foley:
- Skin on wood texture
- Tool passing weight shift
- Hand clasp contact
- Phone grip subtle movement
- Trembling captured in audio
- Steadying hands gentle contact

## Camera Technical Specs (Emily's Precision)

### Lens Selection by Scene Type:

**Intimate Moments (Scenes 1, 12, 15, 16):**
- 50mm-100mm spherical
- T2.0-T2.8 (shallow DOF)
- Close to macro range
- Emotional connection emphasis

**Environmental/Landscape (Scenes 3, 7, 11):**
- 28mm-40mm spherical
- T5.6-T8.0 (deep DOF)
- Wide to medium-wide
- Context and scale

**Observational/Tension (Scenes 4, 5, 6, 8):**
- 35mm-50mm spherical
- T2.8-T4.0 (moderate DOF)
- Clinical distance
- Objective observation

### Camera Motion Rules:

**Emily's Law: ONE PRIMARY MOTION PER SCENE**

Allowed:
- Dolly-in (approaching emotion)
- Dolly-back (retreating, distance)
- Arc (revealing isolation)
- Static (tension through stillness)

Not allowed:
- Multiple moves per scene (confusing)
- Handheld (wrong aesthetic)
- Fast motion (breaks Ghibli feel)
- Unnecessary movement (stillness is powerful)

---

## Extended Scene Options

Some scenes can be extended beyond 8 seconds for pacing:

**Scene 3 (Field Walk):** Extend to 15-20 seconds
- Gives time to breathe in Act 1
- Emphasizes pastoral beauty
- Makes departure in Act 2 more painful

**Scene 11 (Years Pass):** Extend to 20-30 seconds
- Time-lapse montage needs room
- Multiple seasonal cycles
- Shows weight of years apart

**Scene 16 (Evening Porch):** Extend to 12-15 seconds
- Emotional peak needs space
- Silence should be comfortable, not rushed
- Object passing moment needs weight

**Scene 18 (Final Shot):** Extend to 10-12 seconds
- Final statement needs to land
- Birdhouse reveal to apartment context
- Peaceful fade deserves time

**Total Runtime with Extensions:** ~15-18 minutes (perfect for festival short)

---

## Post-Production Assembly Guide

### Editing Sequence:

1. **Assemble base timeline** with all 18 scenes in order
2. **Extend key scenes** (3, 11, 16, 18) for emotional pacing
3. **Add transition treatments:**
   - Hard cuts: Within acts (immediate, present)
   - Dissolves: Between acts (time passing, transformation)
   - Fade to black: After Scene 7 (departure) and before Scene 8 (time jump)
4. **Layer music composition** following 4-act theme structure
5. **Add environmental sound design** for realism and depth
6. **Final color grade pass** ensuring act-to-act consistency

### Pacing Notes:

**Act 1 (Scenes 1-3):** Slow, leisurely, time to fall in love with them
- Total runtime: ~3 minutes (including Scene 3 extension)

**Act 2 (Scenes 4-7):** Deliberate, uncomfortable, tension building
- Total runtime: ~2.5 minutes (moments should hurt)

**Act 3 (Scenes 8-11):** Melancholic, time drags, isolation felt
- Total runtime: ~4 minutes (including Scene 11 montage extension)

**Act 4 (Scenes 12-18):** Earned resolution, peaceful, complete
- Total runtime: ~5 minutes (including extensions, longest act - redemption takes time)

**Total:** ~14-15 minutes

## Generating Scenes with Veo3

### Command Structure for Each Scene:

```bash
veo generate \
  --prompt "$(cat scene-01-prompt.txt)" \
  --model veo-3.0-generate \
  --aspect-ratio 16:9 \
  --duration 8 \
  --output outputs/10-31-2025/the-distance-between-father-son/scenes/scene-01-morning-kitchen.mp4
```

### Batch Generation Script:

Create a script to generate all 18 scenes sequentially:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

SESSION_DIR="outputs/10-31-2025/the-distance-between-father-son"
SCENES_DIR="$SESSION_DIR/scenes"
PROMPTS_FILE="$SESSION_DIR/complete-video-prompts.json"

mkdir -p "$SCENES_DIR"

# Extract and generate each scene
for i in {1..18}; do
  echo "Generating Scene $i..."

  # Extract scene prompt (you'll need to parse JSON or create individual prompt files)
  veo generate \
    --prompt "[extracted scene $i prompt]" \
    --model veo-3.0-generate \
    --aspect-ratio 16:9 \
    --duration 8 \
    --output "$SCENES_DIR/scene-$(printf '%02d' $i).mp4"

  echo "Scene $i complete. Waiting 30s before next..."
  sleep 30
done

echo "All 18 scenes generated!"
```

### Quality Settings:

**For Preview/Draft:**
- Model: `veo-3.0-fast-generate-preview` (faster, cheaper)
- Review aesthetic quickly

**For Final Production:**
- Model: `veo-3.0-generate` (highest quality)
- Cinematic detail and Ghibli aesthetic fidelity

---

## Music Production Workflow

### Step 1: Create Core Themes

**Theme 1 - Wonder (Act 1):**
- Compose 2-minute piano + strings piece
- Key: G Major, 72 BPM
- Variations needed for Scenes 1, 2, 3

**Theme 2 - Fracture (Act 2):**
- Compose dissonant transformation
- Key: D Minor, variable tempo
- Silence gaps important

**Theme 3 - Distance (Act 3):**
- Compose solo cello piece
- Key: E Minor, 55 BPM
- Sparse, minimalist

**Theme 4 - Return (Act 4):**
- Compose full orchestral version of Theme 1
- Key: G Major, 68 BPM
- Mature, complete, bittersweet

### Step 2: Scene-Specific Cues

Each scene needs tailored music cut from themes:

**Scene 4 (Plate Crash):** Music CUTS to silence at crash, slowly returns
**Scene 7 (Leaving):** Theme 2 transforms to Theme 3 during wave
**Scene 11 (Montage):** All 4 themes cycle with seasons
**Scene 15 (Workshop Return):** Theme 1 returns (emotional peak)
**Scene 18 (Final):** Theme 4 full statement, gentle fade

### Step 3: Mix and Master

- Dialogue is silent (mix has room for music to breathe)
- Environmental sounds support but don't compete
- Music carries 80% of emotional weight
- Foley adds realism (hands, tools, movement)
