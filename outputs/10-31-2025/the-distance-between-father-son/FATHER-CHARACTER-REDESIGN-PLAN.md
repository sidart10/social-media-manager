# Father Character Redesign Plan
## Corrections Based on User Feedback

**Date**: October 31, 2025
**Issue**: Current father references are too stereotypical, mustache too thick, clothing too traditional

---

## üîç User Feedback Analysis

### Problems Identified:

1. **Mustache too thick** - Currently looks like handlebar/bushy style
2. **"Too Indian"** - Character feels stereotypical rather than universal
3. **Traditional clothing** - Kurta is too culture-specific
4. **Needs "normal man clothes"** - Everyday universal clothing

### What User Wants:

‚úÖ **Subtle thin mustache** - Like 70s/80s style, barely there
‚úÖ **Universal appearance** - South Asian heritage but not stereotypical
‚úÖ **Normal everyday clothes** - T-shirt, jeans, flannel, button-up (not kurta)
‚úÖ **Less "ethnic costume"** - More relatable, everyday father figure
‚úÖ **Same person across ages** - Just aging, not changing
