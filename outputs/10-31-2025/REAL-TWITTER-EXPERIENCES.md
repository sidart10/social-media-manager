# REAL DEVELOPER EXPERIENCES FROM TWITTER/X (Oct 2025)

## What Developers Are ACTUALLY Saying

### Claude Code vs Codex (Real Test - Ian Nuttall, Oct 2025):

**Test:** Build Next.js app with Tailwind 4 + shadcn
**Results:**
- **Codex:** Couldn't produce working app after 30 minutes
- **Claude Code (Opus 4.1):** Working demo in fraction of the time, 33K tokens
- **Cursor Agent:** Working code but used 188K tokens (5.5x more expensive)

### GPT-5-Codex vs Claude Code (Kaelin Hooper, Sept 2025):

**Quote:** "Tested GPT-5-Codex vs Claude Code on the same feature:
- GPT-5-Codex: Slow, poor UI, failed after 10+ fix attempts
- Claude Code (Opus 4.1): Fast, great UI, worked in 3 tries

Claude Code wins easily"

### Claude Code vs Cursor UX (Christina @ATX):

**Claude Code:**
- Simpler to operate
- More consistent
- Easy parallel sessions
- BUT: Harder setup

**Cursor:**
- Dead easy setup
- Better visual feedback
- BUT: Less consistent, uses way more tokens

### Cursor Still Wins for Some (Ian Nuttall):

"Cursor still wins for me. Claude Code is so fast, I love:
- that it just does things with little yap
- the todos it builds
- tracking tokens

However: Cursor UI is hard to beat for vibe coders"

### Claude 4.5 vs GPT-5 Sentiment:

**Mark Kretschmann:** "Claude 4.5 beating GPT-5 in some benchmarks"
**AM @NidarMMV2:** "claude 4.5 sonnet in cursor feels really bad somehow worse than claude 4"
**Riley Brown:** "Is Claude 4.5 better than GPT-5 Codex?" (Active debate, no consensus)

### Claude Haiku 4.5 Reaction (Dan Shipper, Oct 15):

"Been testing Haiku 4.5 internally - almost as smart as Sonnet 4.5, faster than Sonnet"

**Speed improvement:** 8 seconds â†’ under 3 seconds

## KEY INSIGHTS FOR AUTHENTIC CONTENT

### What's TRUE:
1. **Codex has major UX issues** (slow, poor UI, fails often)
2. **Claude Code is fast and reliable** (works in fewer attempts)
3. **Cursor has best UX** but uses 5.5x more tokens (expensive)
4. **Claude 4.5 vs GPT-5 is actively debated** (no clear winner, depends on task)
5. **Haiku 4.5 is a speed/cost revolution** (real developer praise)

### What's DEBATABLE:
- Which model is "best" (depends on use case, active flame wars)
- Whether Claude 4.5 is better than GPT-5 (mixed opinions)
- Whether tools are converging or diverging

### What sid SHOULDN'T Claim:
- "I tested for 30 days" (unless you actually did)
- "I ran 100 coding tasks" (fabricated metric)
- Specific tier rankings without real testing

## RECOMMENDED APPROACH

**Option A: Write from Community Sentiment**
- "Developers on X are split on GPT-5 vs Claude 4.5"
- "Recent tests show Claude Code wins on speed, Cursor wins on UX"
- Cite real developers: @iannuttall, @KaelinHooper, etc.

**Option B: Write What You Genuinely Know**
- General observations about the tools
- What the benchmarks say (with caveats)
- "Here's what the data shows" vs "I tested"

**Option C: Honest Take**
- "I haven't tested all 3 extensively, but here's what developers are finding..."
- Then cite real experiences
- Your authentic voice = admit what you don't know

**Which approach for tomorrow's content?**
