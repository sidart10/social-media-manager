## 💰 Cost Estimate

**Fast Model Pricing:**
- Lower than standard model
- ~9 scenes × ~8 seconds = ~72 seconds total
- Estimated: **~$20-25** (vs $36 with slow model)

## 📊 What Happened (Troubleshooting Summary)

### ❌ Attempts That Failed:
1. `veo plan-run` with `veo-3.0-generate-preview` → Internal server errors
2. `veo plan-run` with `--reference` PNG images → Format error (expects JSON)
3. Multiple CLI parameter combinations → Various errors

### ✅ What Works:
1. **veo-3.0-fast-generate-preview** model → Confirmed working!
2. **Text-to-video** (no image references) → Working
3. **veo plan-run** with fast model → Currently running!

### 🎯 Key Lesson:
The **FAST** model is more reliable and 10x faster (52 sec vs multiple minutes per scene).

## ⚠️ Character Consistency Strategy

Since we can't use `--reference` with PNG images in CLI, character consistency relies on:

1. **Detailed text description** - "Male 30s dark navy jacket worn brown boots short dark hair stubble determined"
2. **Seed frame continuity** - Each scene's last frame seeds the next (`--seed-last-frame`)
3. **Gemini's consistency engine** - AI maintains character across scenes

The character reference images we created are a backup if specific scenes need regeneration.

---

## 🎬 Monitoring

**To check real-time progress:**
```bash
# Watch the log file
tail -f THE-JOURNEY-generation.log

# Check for new videos
watch -n 5 "ls -lh output/videos/"

# Check process status
ps aux | grep "veo plan-run" | grep ce7087
```

---

## 📋 Next Steps When Complete

### When you see `stitched_*.mp4` appear (~12-15 min):

1. **Review the final video**
2. **Check character consistency** across all 9 scenes
3. **If adjustments needed:**
   - Regenerate specific scenes with more detailed prompts
   - Use your Emily JSON detailed prompts for precision
   - Use character reference images for exact consistency

## 🎯 Current Status: ⚙️ RUNNING

**The ONE-COMMAND CLI approach is working!**

**Process ce7087 is:**
- Planning 9 scenes with Gemini
- Generating all scenes with Veo Fast
- Using seed frames for continuity
- Auto-stitching the final video

**Come back in 12-15 minutes for your finished 60-second cinematic masterpiece!**

**Files Ready:**
- ✅ Emily-style JSON (your detailed prompts)
- ✅ Character references (Love, Death & Robots style)
- ✅ Veotools CLI installed and tested
- ✅ Generation in progress!

**THE JOURNEY is being born. 🎬**
