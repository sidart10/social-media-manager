# 🎬 THE JOURNEY - Generation Status
**Updated**: 2025-10-31 03:12 AM PST
**Status**: ⚙️ RUNNING - Gemini Planning Phase

---

## ✅ ONE-COMMAND EXECUTION IN PROGRESS

### Command Running:
```bash
veo plan-run \
  --idea "Man walks through changing landscapes toward door in void" \
  --scenes 9 \
  --execute-model veo-3.0-generate-preview \
  --seed-last-frame \
  --save-plan test-plan.json
```

**Process IDs**:
- PID 14265: Simple test (running)
- PID 13144: Detailed version (running)

---

## 📊 Current Phase: Gemini Planning

**What's happening now:**
1. ✅ Gemini 2.5 Pro is generating a 9-scene storyboard
2. ⏳ Creating detailed prompts for each scene
3. ⏳ Planning camera angles, transitions, character consistency
4. ⏳ Structuring for Veo execution

**Expected planning time:** 30-90 seconds for 9 scenes

---

## 🎯 What Happens Next (Automatic)

### Phase 1: Planning (Current - ~1-2 min)
- Gemini generates scene-by-scene plan
- Saves to `test-plan.json` or `veo-generated-plan.json`

### Phase 2: Scene Generation (~30-45 min per scene)
- Scene 1: Desert sunrise (7s) - Uses seed for Scene 2
- Scene 2: Canyon midday (6s) - Uses seed for Scene 3
- Scene 3: Forest transition (7s) - Uses seed for Scene 4
- Scene 4: Storm rain (7s) - Uses seed for Scene 5
- Scene 5: Winter snow (7s) - Uses seed for Scene 6
- Scene 6: Night stars (7s) - Uses seed for Scene 7
- Scene 7: Void approach (7s) - Uses seed for Scene 8
- Scene 8: Door moment (6s) - Uses seed for Scene 9
- Scene 9: Zoom reveal (6s) - Final scene

**Total generation time:** 4-6 hours (all automatic)

### Phase 3: Stitching (~5-10 min)
- Automatic FFmpeg stitching with audio preservation
- Overlap trim between scenes
- Final video: `stitched_THE_JOURNEY.mp4`

## 📋 Monitoring

**To check progress manually:**
```bash
# Check if plan is generated
ls -lh outputs/10-31-2025/cinematic-short-journey/*.json

# Check if videos are being created
ls -lh output/videos/

# Watch log file
tail -f outputs/10-31-2025/cinematic-short-journey/generation-log.txt
```

**To check running processes:**
```bash
ps aux | grep veo | grep -v grep
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Character Consistency Approach:
Since `veo plan-run` doesn't support direct image-to-video with character references, we're relying on:
1. **Detailed character description** in parameters
2. **Seed frame continuity** (`--seed-last-frame`) - Each scene's last frame seeds the next
3. **Gemini's consistency engine** - Will try to maintain character across scenes

### Limitation:
The character references we generated won't be directly used by this command. Veo will generate the character from the text description. If you need **exact** character consistency matching the reference images, we'll need to use manual scene-by-scene generation with `--from-image` parameter.

---

## 🎬 Next Steps

### When Generation Completes (4-7 hours):
1. Check `output/videos/stitched_*.mp4`
2. Review character consistency across scenes
3. If character varies too much, we can:
   - Re-generate specific scenes with `--from-image` using character refs
   - Use manual approach with Emily-style detailed prompts per scene

### Current Status:
**⚙️ RUNNING - Be patient, this will take several hours**

The process is fully automated. You can:
- Leave it running overnight
- Check back in 4-6 hours
- Monitor the `output/videos/` directory for new files

**I'll keep monitoring and update you when I see progress!**
