Using character from reference image: male in 30s in dark weathered navy jacket and worn brown boots walking steadily toward camera across vast desert at golden hour sunrise. LOW ANGLE 0.8m height looking slightly up at character approaching. Slow dolly-in push from extreme wide to wide. 24mm wide-angle lens. Gimbal-stable smooth cinematic. T4.0 aperture deep focus. ENVIRONMENT: Epic scale rolling sand dunes, warm sunrise key from camera-right casting long dramatic shadows, soft golden fill, orange purple red sky, distant mountains silhouetted, clear dry heat. BEATS 0-2.5s: Distant traveler small against vast dunes, sunrise breaks over mountains painting sky deep oranges purples, camera begins push-in, sand particles drift, long shadows stretch, heat shimmer beginning. 2.5-5s: Traveler grows larger in frame, steady unwavering pace, boots creating footprints, jacket flutters in desert wind, cloth micro-movement, sand compresses under boots, parallax movement. 5-7s: Wide shot full body, continues forward, gaze fixed on horizon, determined expression visible, sunrise light catches face, breath visible in cool morning air, jacket settles, sand trail behind. Stylized CGI, high detail, atmospheric, epic beginning-of-journey energy." \

ENVIRONMENT: Narrow red desert canyon towering walls, harsh midday sun overhead, extreme heat, brutal lighting creating stark vertical shadows, heat waves rippling visibly. SUBJECT: Walking frame-right, profile view, sweat glistening on face and neck, unwavering pace, tested but unbroken. BEATS 0-2s: Tracking establishes traveler through canyon, walls towering, heat waves ripple, camera moves smoothly, sweat droplets form, heat shimmer distorts depth. 2-4s: Canyon narrows, partial shadow but heat oppressive, pace unchanged, sweat soaks shirt collar, cloth darkens with moisture, dust kicked by boots hangs in still air. 4-6s: Holds tracking showing determined profile against red wall, harsh sunlight from above, breath heavy but controlled, shadows sharp, heat radiates from walls. Stylized CGI, high contrast, quiet resolve despite harsh conditions." \
