## üé® CAROUSEL DECISION

**LinkedIn post would benefit from 5-slide carousel:**
- Impact: 278% more engagement vs text-only

- Handoff package ready: `handoff-to-image-agent-linkedin-framework.json`

**To create carousel:**
```
"/ai-image-generator *carousel"
```

AI Image Generator will:

- Save to `outputs/10-31-2025/images/`

**Your call:** Create carousel OR post text-only?

## ‚è∞ TOMORROW MORNING WORKFLOW

### Option A: Publish Manually (Full Control)

**8:00 AM - Wake up**
1. Open Notion Content Tracker
2. Filter: Publish Date = Oct 31, Status = Editing
3. Review all 6 pieces in "Content Text" fields
4. Make any edits you want
5. Copy content to platforms manually:
   - Twitter thread at 8:30 AM
   - LinkedIn at 9:00 AM (with carousel if created)
   - etc.
6. After publishing, change Status to "Posted" in Notion

**Time:** ~1.5 hours (review + manual posting)

### Option B: Semi-Automated (Recommended)

**8:00 AM - Wake up**
1. Open Notion, review all 6 pieces
2. Make any edits directly in Notion
3. When satisfied, ask me to publish:
   ```
   "Post the GPT-5 thread to Twitter"
   "Post the LinkedIn framework to LinkedIn"
   ```
4. Social Posting Agent handles publishing
5. Notion auto-updates to "Posted" with URLs

**Time:** ~45 minutes (review + automated publishing)

### Option C: Carousel First, Then Publish

**If creating carousel:**
1. Say: "/ai-image-generator *carousel"
