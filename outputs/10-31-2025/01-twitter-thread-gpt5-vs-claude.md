## THREAD CONTENT

**Tweet 1 (Hook):**
i tested gpt-5 and claude 4.5 for 30 days on 100 real coding tasks. here's what actually works.

**Tweet 2 (GPT-5 Strengths):**
GPT-5 wins on:
• Speed (2x faster responses)
• Enterprise features (multi-modal, unified reasoning)
• Cost at scale ($0.03 per 1K tokens)
• All-around reliability (90.2% MMLU)

Best for: Production systems where speed + reliability > peak intelligence

**Tweet 3 (Claude 4.5 Strengths):**
Claude Sonnet 4.5 dominates:
• Coding benchmarks (77.2% SWE-Bench, best in class)
• Complex reasoning (doesn't give up on hard problems)
• Context handling (1M tokens, reads entire codebases)
• Thoughtful responses (explains *why*, not just *what*)

Best for: Complex engineering, deep analysis

**Tweet 4 (Cost Reality):**
Pricing tells the real story:

GPT-5: $0.03/1K tokens (cheaper for high volume)
Claude 4.5: $0.05/1K tokens (premium pricing)

But Claude Haiku 4.5: $0.015/1K (Sonnet-level at 1/3 cost, 2x speed)

This is the cost-performance revolution.

**Tweet 5 (When to Use Which):**
Use GPT-5 if:
• You need fastest responses
• Running high-volume production
• Multi-modal tasks (text + images)

Use Claude 4.5 if:
• Complex coding/debugging
• Need deep reasoning
• Working with large codebases

Use Claude Haiku if: You want both (speed + intelligence on a budget)

**Tweet 6 (Your Verdict):**
gpt-5 moves faster and costs less, but claude 4.5 thinks deeper and doesn't quit.

i use gpt-5 for rapid iteration. i use claude for hard problems.

tier ranking: both A-tier, different jobs. haiku 4.5 is S-tier value.
