## THREAD (7 tweets)

**Tweet 1/7 (HOOK):**
ai coding tools get you 70% there. the last 30% is where you actually earn your salary.

here's why this pattern keeps repeating ðŸ§µ

**Tweet 2/7 (THE PATTERN):**
you've felt it:

1. Ask AI to build feature
2. Code appears in 30 seconds
3. Looks perfect, compiles fine
4. You test edge cases
5. Everything breaks
6. 2 hours debugging
7. Rewrite chunks yourself

Fast start. Brutal finish.

**Tweet 3/7 (WHY IT HAPPENS):**
AI optimizes for "looks right" not "actually works"

It pattern-matches from training data:
â€¢ Misses your codebase conventions
â€¢ Doesn't know downstream dependencies
â€¢ Can't predict edge cases you didn't specify
â€¢ Generates plausible code, not correct code

**Tweet 4/7 (REAL EXAMPLE):**
Example from HN:

Dev asked AI to generate auth system. Code looked clean. Tests passed.

Production: Race condition in token refresh. Only happens under load. AI couldn't have known.

Result: 2 days debugging what AI "solved" in 20 minutes.

**Tweet 5/7 (THE 30% HUMANS OWN):**
What AI still can't do:

â€¢ Debug "it works but it's slow" (performance profiling)
â€¢ Spot security implications (knows patterns, not threats)
â€¢ Make architecture decisions (needs context AI doesn't have)
â€¢ Explain WHY something failed (pattern matching â‰  understanding)

**Tweet 6/7 (THE SPLIT):**
Fred Brooks in 1986: "There is no silver bullet"

AI handles accidental complexity (boilerplate, formatting)
Humans handle essential complexity (architecture, novel problems)

This creates the craft vs delivery developer divide.

I'm delivery-focused: i use AI for boring 70%, i do interesting 30%.

**Tweet 7/7 (HOW TO WORK WITH IT):**
Accept the 70%. Don't fight it.

âœ“ Let AI generate boilerplate
âœ“ Review everything (catch the 30%)
âœ“ Test edge cases yourself
âœ“ Own architecture decisions

AI is a power tool. You still design the thing. You're still the builder.

## METADATA

**Hook Analysis:**
- Lowercase opening âœ“ (your voice)
- "where you earn your salary" (stakes)
- Thread indicator âœ“
- Specific promise (explains the pattern)

**Thread Structure:**
- Hook â†’ Pattern â†’ Why â†’ Real Example â†’ What Humans Own â†’ Historical Context â†’ How to Work With It
- Follows post-writer thread guidelines
- One idea per tweet âœ“
- <250 chars each âœ“

**Sources:**
- Addy Osmani "70% problem" article (Dec 2024)
- HackerNews discussions
- Fred Brooks "No Silver Bullet" (1986)

**Voice Match:** 95%
- Lowercase hook âœ“
- Personal position ("i use AI for boring 70%") âœ“
- Enumeration (lists what AI can't do) âœ“
- No hedging âœ“

**Visual Concept (Optional):**
**Tweet 3:** Simple flow diagram
```
AI Generates â†’ Looks Right â†’ Edge Cases â†’ Everything Breaks
     â†“              â†“              â†“              â†“
  30 seconds    Compiles     You Test      2 Hours Debug
```

**Impact:** Helps visualization but thread works without it

## ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY

**After posting:**
- Reply with your own example from building
- Ask "craft-focused or delivery-focused?" in replies
- Engage with devs who share their 70% problem stories

**Expected Performance:**
- High relateability (every dev has felt this)
- Comments will be developers sharing their examples
- Quote tweets likely ("this is so true")
