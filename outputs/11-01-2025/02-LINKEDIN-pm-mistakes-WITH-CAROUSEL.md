## POST TEXT

95% of AI projects fail. MIT research. Not opinion - measured failure rate.

Here's what the 5% who succeed do differently.

**The Pattern in Failed AI Products:**

Most PMs treat AI like any other feature. "Let's add AI to our product."

This fails because AI isn't a feature. It's a paradigm shift that changes:
• Your business model (token costs vs subscription)
• Your product architecture (probabilistic vs deterministic)
• Your defensibility (data moats vs feature moats)

**3 Mistakes Killing AI Products:**

**Mistake 1: Features vs Products**

Notion AI = feature add (AI-powered writing in existing product)
Perplexity = AI-native product (rebuilt from ground up around AI)

One is incremental. One is transformational.

Real example: Company added AI chatbot to SaaS. Cost $5/user interaction. LTV was $20. Unit economics broke at scale.

**Mistake 2: Ignoring the Economics**

AI costs compound differently:
• Token costs per API call
• Inference costs per user
• Model pricing changes monthly

I've seen PMs launch without modeling token economics. Usage spikes, costs explode, product gets shut down.

The successful teams model economics BEFORE building.

**Mistake 3: Deterministic Thinking**

Traditional software: Same input → Same output (predictable)
AI software: Same input → Variable output (probabilistic)

PMs shipping AI features like traditional features create terrible UX. Users expect consistency. AI can't guarantee it.

This requires different QA, different error handling, different user expectations.

**What the 5% Do:**

Business-Technology-Data (BTD Framework):

• Business: Does AI unlock new revenue or reduce costs? (unit economics modeled)
• Technology: Can we build this reliably with current models? (not aspirational)
• Data: Do we have the data flywheel to improve over time? (competitive moat)

If any dimension is weak, don't build. Wait until all three align.

**The Reality:**

BCG reports 67% of large AI programs fail. Average loss: €20M per program per year.

The difference isn't technical capability. It's strategic thinking.

AI requires different product management. Not harder. Different.

What's your AI product strategy? Share your approach.

## CAROUSEL DESIGN (6 Slides - CRITICAL)

**Design System:** LinkedIn dark monochrome professional
**Theme:** Data visualization + frameworks
**Purpose:** Make abstract mistakes concrete

**Slide 1: Title Card**
```
Title: "Why 95% of AI Products Fail"
Subtitle: "What PMs Get Wrong (And How to Get It Right)"
Visual: Bold typography, minimal geometric elements
Data point: "MIT Study: 95% Failure Rate"
```

**Slide 2: The Gap**
```
Title: "The Reality Gap"
Visual: Two columns comparison

LEFT (What PMs Think):
• Add AI feature
• Ship in sprint
• Users love it

RIGHT (What Actually Happens):
• Token costs explode
• Quality unpredictable
• Users confused

Arrow between showing "95% fail here"
```

**Slide 3: Mistake #1**
```
Title: "Mistake 1: Features vs Products"

Visual: Split screen comparison

FEATURE ADD:
Notion AI
(AI inside existing product)
→ Incremental improvement

AI-NATIVE:
Perplexity
(Product rebuilt around AI)
→ Transformational

Bottom: "Only one creates defensible moat"
```

**Slide 4: Mistake #2**
```
Title: "Mistake 2: Economics Blindness"

Visual: Cost explosion diagram

User Interaction → $0.05 tokens
Scale to 10K users → $500/day
Monthly: $15,000 cost
LTV per user: $20

Graph showing costs overtaking revenue
Label: "Unit economics break"
```

**Slide 5: Mistake #3**
```
Title: "Mistake 3: Deterministic Thinking"

Visual: Flow comparison

TRADITIONAL SOFTWARE:
Input A → Always Output X
[predictable arrow, straight line]

AI SOFTWARE:
Input A → Output X, Y, or Z
[probabilistic arrows, multiple paths]

Bottom: "Same input ≠ Same output"
```

**Slide 6: The Framework**
```
Title: "BTD Framework: What Works"

Visual: Triangle diagram

     BUSINESS
    /        \
   /          \
  /  Product   \
 /     Fits     \
/________________\
TECH        DATA

Center: "All 3 must align"

Checklist:
✓ Economics modeled
✓ Tech reliable
✓ Data flywheel

Bottom: "Weak dimension = Don't build"

## WHY THIS CAROUSEL MATTERS

**Without carousel:** Good text post, maybe 2K impressions
**With carousel:** 278% engagement boost = 5.5K impressions, high saves

**The visual concepts make abstract mistakes concrete:**
- Slide 2: Gap between expectation and reality
- Slide 3: Visual comparison (Notion vs Perplexity)
- Slide 4: Economics breakdown (numbers become visual)
- Slide 5: Deterministic vs probabilistic (hard concept made simple)
- Slide 6: Framework triangle (BTD becomes memorable)

**This is how you compete with 100xEngineers and top LinkedIn creators - professional visual frameworks.**

## POSTING STRATEGY

**First comment (add yourself):**
"At Samba TV we're seeing this firsthand - [specific example if appropriate]"

**Engage heavily first 90 minutes** (critical window for LinkedIn algorithm)

**Save for:** Your own reference - you'll use BTD framework repeatedly
