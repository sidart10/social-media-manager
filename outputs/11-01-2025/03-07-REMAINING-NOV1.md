# Friday Nov 1 - Remaining 5 Pieces (Complete)

## PIECE 3: Twitter Long-Form (2:15 PM) ⭐

**Title:** Anthropic is the Most Confident Company

**Content:**
```
Anthropic is the most confident company among all AI labs.

It seems like everyone else is throwing darts at the wall. Don't get me wrong, other labs have figured out many new things that Anthropic hasn't.

But Anthropic seems to know the path they're on and are executing accordingly.

Three distinct eras:

Era 1: Passing the Turing test
They built Claude to be helpful, harmless, and honest. While others chased benchmarks, Anthropic focused on alignment from day one.

Era 2: Reasoning and safety
Constitutional AI. They didn't just make models smarter - they made them steerable and safe. This is their moat.

Era 3: Agents
Computer Use (Oct 2024). Agent Skills (Oct 2025). Claude Code. They're not just talking about agents - they're shipping the infrastructure.

What sets them apart:

Every other lab pivots with each new capability. OpenAI is building consumer products like a YC company. Google is playing catch-up. xAI is chasing benchmarks.

Anthropic has a thesis: Safe, steerable, agentic AI. And they're executing on it methodically.

The proof:
• Claude 4.5 Sonnet: Best coding model (77.2% SWE-Bench)
• Claude Haiku 4.5: Changed the economics ($1/$5 per million tokens)
• Agent Skills: First modular agent system
• Computer Use: First AI that actually controls computers

While others announce, Anthropic ships.

My take: Anthropic is the biggest dark horse in the race toward superintelligence.

They're not the loudest. They're not the fastest to market. But they might be the most deliberate.

And in AI, deliberate execution compounds.

## PIECE 4: Substack Note (11:00 AM)

**Content:**
```
Claude Haiku 4.5 is the cost-performance revolution nobody's talking about.

Released Oct 15. $1/$5 per million tokens. Sonnet 4-level performance at 1/3 cost and 2x speed.

Real developer (@danshipper): "almost as smart as Sonnet 4.5, faster than Sonnet"

Another dev: Wait time dropped from 8 seconds → 3 seconds.

This just changed the economics of building with AI. You can prototype at Haiku speed/cost, deploy to Sonnet when you need peak intelligence.

The breakthrough: You don't have to choose between fast and smart anymore.

- Specific performance (8s → 3s)

**Factual:** ✅ All verified

## PIECE 5: Substack Note (4:00 PM)

**Content:**
```
H-1B $100K fee update (Sep 19 policy):

The fee applies to NEW petitions only, for workers outside the US. Not renewals. Employers pay, not workers.

What this means:
• Existing H-1B workers: Not affected
• Renewals: Not affected
• New hires from abroad: Employer pays $100K extra

Florida just banned H-1B use at public universities (Oct 29). This is accelerating.

Longer analysis coming next week on the H-1B + AI intersection. The question nobody's asking: Does AI make foreign tech workers more or less valuable?

Stay informed. Policy changes fast.
