## COMPLETE THREAD (10 tweets + 3 images)

### Tweet 1/10 (HOOK):

Anthropic shipped Agent Skills last month.

Most people think they're just "better prompts."

They're not. Agent Skills are the missing architecture layer between raw LLMs and production agents.

Here's why this matters for anyone building AI systems:

🧵

### Tweet 2/10:

Don't get me wrong - prompts work for demos.

But production agents need:
• Context management (can't reload 2000 tokens every call)
• Tool orchestration (which MCP, when, in what order)
• Procedural memory (your workflows, not generic instructions)
• Team coordination (sharing expertise across developers)

Traditional approaches fail at scale.

### Tweet 3/10 + IMAGE 1:

Agent Skills solve this through 3-tier progressive disclosure:

**Tier 1: Metadata only (~50 tokens)**

- Skill name + description loaded at startup
- Claude scans ALL skills, loads NONE yet
- Token-efficient discovery

Think: table of contents, not the full manual.

### Tweet 4/10:

**Tier 2: Full instructions (when relevant)**

- SKILL.md loaded only when task matches
- Keep other skills dormant

**Tier 3: Additional resources (on-demand)**

- Reference docs, scripts, templates
- Loaded ONLY when needed

Result: Unbounded context capacity with minimal token overhead.

### Tweet 5/10:

What sets Agent Skills apart from RAG, fine-tuning, or massive system prompts:

RAG retrieves facts. Skills encode _procedures_.

Fine-tuning locks knowledge in weights. Skills update instantly.

System prompts bloat every request. Skills load on-demand.

Procedural knowledge > factual retrieval for agents.

### Tweet 6/10 + IMAGE 2:

The insight everyone's missing: Agent Skills and MCP are _complementary_, not competitive.

**MCP** = External world (connect to GitHub, databases, APIs)
**Skills** = Internal knowledge (HOW to use those tools)

Example:
MCP gives Claude access to your database.
Skills teach it your query optimization patterns.

You need both.

### Tweet 7/10:

Here's where it gets interesting: Skills can bundle executable code.

Why? Some tasks shouldn't burn tokens.

• Sorting a list? Run Python instantly.
• Extracting PDF forms? Use deterministic script.
• Generating creative content? Let Claude reason.

Skills let Claude decide when to execute code vs when to reason.

Efficiency meets flexibility.

### Tweet 8/10 + IMAGE 3:

Production numbers from Anthropic's engineering blog:

• Context efficiency: 100-token metadata vs 2000-token full instructions
• Unlimited capacity: Skills load from filesystem, not context window
• Cross-surface: Same skill works in Claude.ai, Claude Code, API, Agent SDK
• Team distribution: Git-based sharing, instant availability

This is architecture for scale, not toys.

### Tweet 9/10:

I built 12 skills for my social media agent:

• deep-web-research (Exa + Apify orchestration)
• post-writer (Justin Welsh + Greg Isenberg formulas)
• voice-matcher (77 posts analyzed, 8/10 confidence)

Each skill is 200-500 lines. Workflows compose them.

Result: Research → Strategy → Creation pipeline, all voice-matched, all evidence-backed.

Agent Skills turned generic LLM into domain expert.

### Tweet 10/10:

We're watching the shift from "AI assistants" to "AI operating systems."

Phase 1: Raw prompts (artisanal, fragile)
Phase 2: MCP (tool connectivity)
Phase 3: Agent Skills (procedural knowledge)

Next: Skills that self-modify. Agents that create their own expertise modules.

The cathedral window era of AI agents is ending.

Modular, composable, scalable architecture is here.
