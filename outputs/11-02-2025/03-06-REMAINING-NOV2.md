# Saturday Nov 2 - Remaining 4 Pieces

## PIECE 3: Twitter Long-Form (2:00 PM)

**Content:**
```
ai will create greater separation between the 9-5ers and high-agency folks.

not because AI replaces jobs. because AI amplifies whoever uses it well.

the pattern i'm seeing:

high-agency people are using AI to 10x their output. they're shipping faster, building more, compounding advantages.

9-5ers are waiting for permission, worried about replacement, resisting the tools.

this isn't about intelligence. it's about willingness to adapt.

AI won't replace you. Someone using AI will.

the gap is widening. those who experiment are pulling ahead. those who wait are falling behind.

my evidence: i'm shipping web apps, mobile apps, desktop apps, AI agents. solo. AI-assisted.

couldn't do this 2 years ago. now it's possible.

the separation is real. and it's accelerating.
