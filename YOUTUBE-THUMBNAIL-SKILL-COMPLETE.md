- Don't have quality photo
- Fast iteration
- Brand-only content

**How it works:**
```yaml
mcp__nanobanana__generate_image:
  prompt: "YouTube thumbnail with bold text 'BUILD AI AGENTS', vibrant orange-blue gradient background, abstract tech visual, high contrast..."
  mode: "generate"
  # No input_image_path needed
```

**Workflow:**
1. Describe video topic
2. Choose YouTube design
3. Generate thumbnail from scratch
4. Test at 156×88px (mobile)
5. Done!

**Time**: ~30 seconds
**Cost**: $0.039

---

### Mode B: With Your Image (Personalized)

**When to use:**
- Personal branding important
- Building audience recognition
- Have quality expressive photos
- Want 40% CTR boost from faces!

**How it works:**
```yaml
mcp__nanobanana__generate_image:
  prompt: "YouTube thumbnail: Person from first image with surprised expression, bold text 'THIS CHANGED EVERYTHING', vibrant background..."
  mode: "generate"
  input_image_path_1: "/path/to/your/headshot-surprised.jpg"
```

**Workflow:**
1. Describe video topic
2. Choose YouTube design
3. Provide your image path
4. Choose emotion (surprised/excited/curious/serious)
