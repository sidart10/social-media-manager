# WEEK 1 CONTENT GENERATION - SYSTEMATIC APPROACH
**Theme:** Agent Platform Wars (AgentKit vs Claude SDK vs Vertex AI)
**Date Range:** Nov 4-10, 2025
**Total Pieces:** 46
**Strategy:** Generate in priority order, fact-check each batch, schedule via Postiz

---

## RESEARCH FOUNDATION (Real Data)

**AgentKit (OpenAI, Oct 6 2025):**
- Visual drag-and-drop builder
- Christina Huang built agent in 8 min live demo
- Ramp: 2 quarters → 2 sprints (75% reduction)
- Carlyle: 50% dev time reduction, 30% better accuracy
- Critical take: "You're renting, not building" (centralized control)
- Free until Nov 1, then billing starts

**Claude Agent SDK (Anthropic, Sep 29 2025):**
- Code-first, self-hosted
- Full control via MCP servers
- More setup work but you own the stack
- Best for compliance/data locality
- Modular Agent Skills (Oct 16)

**Real Comparisons:**
- AgentKit: Speed to market
- Claude SDK: Control + flexibility
- No consensus on "best" - depends on use case

## GENERATION STRATEGY

Given 46 pieces and limited time/tokens, I'll:

**Tier 1: Generate Fully (16 pieces)**
- All Priority 1 threads and LinkedIn posts
- These drive most engagement
- Need full quality

**Tier 2: Generate Outlines (20 pieces)**
- Priority 2 posts and notes
- Can flesh out later if needed
- Outlines ensure consistency

**Tier 3: Templates Only (10 pieces)**
- Priority 3 philosophy shorts (already written in voice profile)
- Simple notes/teasers
- Low-lift, proven content

This gets all 46 pieces ready while managing quality vs volume.

## MONDAY NOV 4 - COMPLETE (7 pieces)

✅ Thread - AgentKit first impressions (DONE)
✅ LinkedIn - Strategic implications (DONE)
✅ Long-form - Cost reality (DONE)
✅ 2 Substack Notes (DONE)
✅ 2 Twitter Shorts (DONE)

**Status:** Ready to schedule

## TUESDAY NOV 5 - PRIORITY (7 pieces + VIDEO)

**High Priority:**
1. Thread - Claude SDK vs AgentKit head-to-head
2. LinkedIn - Agent reliability problem (60% reality)
3. VIDEO SCRIPT - I built same agent on both platforms

**Medium:**
4. Long-form - Platform lock-in
5-6. Substack Notes (2)

**Low:**
7-8. Twitter shorts (2)

## WED-SAT (Remaining ~32 pieces)

**Wednesday:** Limitations thread, PM decision framework LinkedIn + carousel
**Thursday:** Google Vertex, workflows vs agents
**Friday:** Production failures, roadmap
**Saturday:** MCP explanation, Week 1 synthesis

---

## EXECUTION PLAN

**Now (Tonight):**
- Generate Mon-Tue content fully (14 pieces)
- Schedule via Postiz
- Get ahead for week

**Later (if needed):**
- Generate Wed-Sat as outlines
- Can flush out daily during execution
- Or batch generate Sunday Nov 3

**Your call:**
- Generate ALL 46 now (big batch, 1-2 hours)?
- Generate Mon-Tue now, rest later (manageable, 30 min)?

**I recommend:** Finish Monday + Tuesday now (14 pieces total). That gets you through first 2 days of Week 1. Generate rest on Sunday Nov 3 when you do agent platform research.

**What's your preference?**
