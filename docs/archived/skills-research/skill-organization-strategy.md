# Skill Organization Strategy - Where Should Skills Live?

**Date:** 2025-10-28
**Question:** "Why is skill-creator in jarvis's skills folder?"
**Answer:** It SHOULDN'T be! Let me fix this.

## The Problem

**Current location:** `.claude/skills/jarvis/skill-creator/`

**Why that's wrong:**
- ❌ skill-creator is NOT Jarvis-specific
- ❌ skill-creator is NOT content-intelligence related
- ❌ skill-creator is UNIVERSAL (works for all domains)
- ❌ Doesn't belong in a category

**Your instinct is RIGHT!**

## Anthropic's Guidance

### Personal vs Project Skills

**From official docs:**

**Personal Skills** (`~/.claude/skills/`)
> "Use personal Skills for:
> - Your individual workflows and preferences
> - Experimental Skills you're developing
> - Personal productivity tools"

**Project Skills** (`.claude/skills/`)
> "Use project Skills for:
> - Team workflows and conventions
> - Project-specific expertise
> - Shared utilities and scripts"

---

## Three Options for skill-creator

### Option 1: Personal Skills (Recommended for Meta-Skills)

**Location:** `~/.claude/skills/skill-creator/`

**Pros:**
- ✅ Available across ALL projects
- ✅ Not tied to social-media-manager
- ✅ Universal utility (creates ANY skill)
- ✅ Personal productivity tool
- ✅ Follows Anthropic guidance

**Cons:**
- Can't share via git (but could package separately)

**Best for:** Universal meta-skills (skill-creator, skill-validator, etc.)

---

### Option 2: Project Root (No Category)

**Location:** `.claude/skills/skill-creator/`

**Pros:**
- ✅ Project-level (team access)
- ✅ Not in a category (not domain-specific)
- ✅ Shared via git
- ✅ Available to team

**Cons:**
- Tied to this project (can't use in other projects without copying)

**Best for:** Project-specific but cross-domain skills

---

### Option 3: Keep in Category (Current - WRONG)

**Location:** `.claude/skills/jarvis/skill-creator/`

**Pros:**
- Organized with other skills

**Cons:**
- ❌ skill-creator NOT content-intelligence specific
- ❌ Creates skills for ALL domains (AI images, videos, anything!)
- ❌ Doesn't belong in Jarvis category
- ❌ Misleading organization

**Best for:** Nothing - this is wrong!

## Current Structure Analysis

### Your Current Organization

```
.claude/skills/
├── jarvis/                      ← Content Intelligence Category
│   ├── deep-web-research/       ✓ Content research
│   ├── post-writer/             ✓ Content creation
│   ├── video-script-writer/     ✓ Content creation
│   ├── youtube-thumbnail-mastery/ ✓ Content strategy
│   ├── youtube-growth-mastery/  ✓ Content strategy
│   └── skill-creator/           ❌ NOT content-specific!
│
└── ai-image-generator/          ← Image Generation Category
    ├── create-image/            ✓ Image generation
    ├── edit-image/              ✓ Image editing
    └── youtube-thumbnail-design/ ✓ Image creation
```

**Problem:** skill-creator doesn't fit Jarvis category!

---

## The Right Organization

### Option A: Personal Skills (RECOMMENDED)

```
~/.claude/skills/                ← Personal (cross-project)
├── skill-creator/               ✓ Universal utility
├── skill-validator/             ✓ Universal utility (future)
└── skill-packager/              ✓ Universal utility (future)

.claude/skills/                  ← Project (domain-specific)
├── jarvis/                      ✓ Content intelligence
│   ├── post-writer/
│   ├── video-script-writer/
│   └── ... (12 skills)
│
└── ai-image-generator/          ✓ Image generation
    ├── create-image/
    └── ... (7 skills)
```

**Separation:**
- Personal: Universal meta-skills
- Project: Domain-specific skills

---

### Option B: Project Root (Alternative)

```
.claude/skills/                  ← Project root
├── skill-creator/               ✓ Project utility (no category)
├── skill-validator/             ✓ Project utility (future)
├── jarvis/                      ✓ Content intelligence category
│   ├── post-writer/
│   └── ...
└── ai-image-generator/          ✓ Image generation category
    ├── create-image/
    └── ...
```

**Separation:**
- Root level: Cross-domain utilities
- Categories: Domain-specific skills

---

## The Master's Recommendation

### Move to Personal Skills

**Why:**
- skill-creator creates skills for ANY domain
- Not specific to social-media-manager project
- Could use in other projects
- Follows Anthropic guidance ("personal productivity tools")

**Action:**
```bash
mv .claude/skills/jarvis/skill-creator ~/.claude/skills/skill-creator
```

**Result:**
- Available in ALL projects
- Not tied to social-media-manager
- Proper organization
- Can create skills for any purpose

---

## Skill Categorization Rules

### When to Put in Category

**Put in jarvis/ if:**
- ✅ Content intelligence specific
- ✅ Research-related
- ✅ Writing/creation focused
- ✅ Social media domain

**Examples:**
- post-writer (creates social posts)
- video-script-writer (creates video scripts)
- deep-web-research (content research)

---

**Put in ai-image-generator/ if:**
- ✅ Image generation specific
- ✅ Visual design focused
- ✅ MCP tool selection for images

**Examples:**
- create-image (generates images)
- youtube-thumbnail-design (thumbnail images)
- blend-images (image composition)

---

### When NOT to Put in Category

**Put at root or personal if:**
- ❌ Cross-domain utility
- ❌ Meta-skill (skill about skills)
- ❌ Works across all categories
- ❌ Universal tool

**Examples:**
- skill-creator (creates ANY skill)
- skill-validator (validates ANY skill)
- skill-packager (packages ANY skill)

---

## Proposed Structure

### Personal Skills (~/.claude/skills/)

```
~/.claude/skills/
├── skill-creator/          # Creates skills (any domain)
├── skill-validator/        # Validates skills (future)
└── skill-packager/         # Packages for sharing (future)
```

**Universal utilities available everywhere!**

---

### Project Skills (.claude/skills/)

```
.claude/skills/
├── jarvis/                 # Content Intelligence
│   ├── deep-web-research/
│   ├── post-writer/
│   ├── video-script-writer/
│   ├── youtube-thumbnail-mastery/
│   ├── youtube-growth-mastery/
│   ├── voice-matcher/
│   ├── platform-formatter/
│   ├── research-synthesizer/
│   ├── evidence-tracker/
│   ├── profile-analysis/
│   ├── social-media-research/
│   └── youtube-research/
│
└── ai-image-generator/     # Image Generation
    ├── create-image/
    ├── edit-image/
    ├── blend-images/
    ├── youtube-thumbnail-design/
    ├── linkedin-design/
    ├── mcp-tool-selection/
    └── platform-specs/
```

**Domain-specific skills organized by purpose!**

---

## The Correct Move

**From:**
```bash
.claude/skills/jarvis/skill-creator/
```

**To:**
```bash
~/.claude/skills/skill-creator/
```

**Why:**
1. Universal utility (not domain-specific)
2. Works across all projects
3. Meta-skill (creates other skills)
4. Follows Anthropic's "personal productivity tools" guidance

---

## Future Organization

### As You Build More Skills

**Personal (~/.claude/skills/):**
- skill-creator
- skill-validator
- skill-packager
- Any other universal utilities

**Project - Jarvis (.claude/skills/jarvis/):**
- All content creation/intelligence skills
- Social media specific
- Research specific

**Project - AI Image (.claude/skills/ai-image-generator/):**
- All image generation skills
- Visual design specific

**Project - New Categories (future):**
- .claude/skills/analytics/ (metrics, reporting)
- .claude/skills/automation/ (scheduling, posting)
- .claude/skills/research/ (if separate from Jarvis)

## Answer to Your Question

**"Why is skill-creator in jarvis's skills folder?"**

**The Master's Answer:**

**It SHOULDN'T be there!**

**skill-creator is:**
- ✅ Universal (works for any domain)
- ✅ Meta-skill (creates other skills)
- ✅ Personal productivity tool

**Should be:**
- ✅ Personal skills (~/.claude/skills/)
- ✅ Available across ALL projects
