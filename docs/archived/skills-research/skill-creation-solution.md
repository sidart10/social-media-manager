# Skill Creation Solution - Build Skills That Follow Best Practices

**Date:** 2025-10-28
**Question:** Should we build a skill-creator agent/workflow/skill?
**Context:** skill-seeker is for documentation scraping, not skill authoring
**Goal:** Create GOOD skills going forward

---

## TL;DR Recommendation

**Build a SKILL to write good SKILLS!**

**Why:**
- ✅ Skills are model-invoked (perfect for this task!)
- ✅ Anthropic already has skill-creator skill (proven pattern)
- ✅ Follows Anthropic best practices automatically
- ✅ Auto-loads when you ask "create a skill"
- ✅ Can reference Anthropic docs we scraped
- ✅ Simpler than workflow (no state/interaction needed)

**Name:** `skill-creator`
**Location:** `.claude/skills/jarvis/skill-creator/`
**Purpose:** Create skills following Anthropic best practices

---

## The Three Options Analyzed

### Option 1: Build Skill-Creator Skill ✅ RECOMMENDED

**Pros:**
- ✅ Model-invoked (auto-loads when you say "create a skill")
- ✅ Follows Anthropic's own pattern (they have skill-creator skill!)
- ✅ Can reference official docs in skill's reference/
- ✅ Simple to use (just ask for skill, it creates it)
- ✅ Composable (could work with other skills)
- ✅ No state management needed (one-shot creation)
- ✅ Can include validation scripts

**Cons:**
- Limited multi-turn interaction (but one-shot usually fine)

**Best for:** Creating individual well-formed skills

---

### Option 2: Build Skill-Creator Workflow

**Pros:**
- ✅ Multi-step orchestration
- ✅ Can ask clarifying questions
- ✅ Can save to specific locations
- ✅ Can create handoff packages

**Cons:**
- ❌ More complex than needed
- ❌ Requires agent to invoke (manual step)
- ❌ State management overkill for one-shot task
- ❌ User-invoked (not automatic)

**Best for:** Complex multi-file skills with dependencies

---

### Option 3: Build Skill-Creator Agent

**Pros:**
- ✅ Full UI (menu, selections)
- ✅ Multi-workflow coordination
- ✅ Can guide through complex processes

**Cons:**
- ❌ Massive overkill for skill creation
- ❌ Need to maintain slash command
- ❌ More moving parts
- ❌ User must invoke explicitly

**Best for:** Large skill libraries, team coordination (way overkill!)

---

## Why Skill-Creator SKILL is Perfect

### Anthropic's Own Approach

**From their announcement:**
> "Creating skills is simple. The 'skill-creator' skill provides interactive guidance: Claude asks about your workflow, generates the folder structure, formats the SKILL.md file, and bundles the resources you need. No manual file editing required."

**They built a SKILL to create skills!**

**Why that's smart:**
- Model-invoked (automatic when you ask)
- Simple (does one thing well)
- Self-documenting (skill that creates skills)
- Composable (can work with research skills)

---

### How It Would Work

**User:** "Create a skill for analyzing Twitter threads"

**Claude recognizes:** Task matches skill-creator description

**skill-creator auto-loads:**
```
Using skill-creator skill to build a new skill...

I'll guide you through creating a well-formed skill following
Anthropic best practices.

**Step 1: Skill Purpose**
What should this skill do? (You said: analyze Twitter threads)

**Step 2: Description (Critical for Discovery)**
Let me craft a specific description with trigger words:

"Analyze Twitter thread structure, engagement patterns, and
viral elements. Use when analyzing tweets, threads, or Twitter
content strategy."

Triggers: Twitter, threads, tweets, engagement, viral
Good? [yes/edit]

**Step 3: Skill Structure**
Based on your purpose, I recommend:
- SKILL.md (core instructions)
- prompts/analysis-template.md (reusable prompt)
- examples/viral-thread-breakdown.md (reference)
- scripts/thread-fetcher.py (fetch thread via API)

Need all of these? [yes/customize]

**Step 4: Generate SKILL.md**
[Creates properly formatted SKILL.md with YAML frontmatter]

**Step 5: Save**
Where to save?
1. Personal: ~/.claude/skills/analyzing-twitter-threads/
2. Project: .claude/skills/jarvis/analyzing-twitter-threads/

Created! Test with: "Analyze this Twitter thread: [URL]"
```

**Result:** Well-formed skill in minutes!

---

## skill-seeker vs skill-creator

### What skill-seeker Does (Different Purpose!)

**Purpose:** Scrape DOCUMENTATION to create reference skills

**Process:**
```
Config → Scrape website → Extract docs → Create SKILL.md
```

**Output:** Skills based on existing documentation (React docs, YouTube guides)

**Good for:**
- Creating skills from documentation websites
- Building reference libraries
- Scraping multi-source content

**NOT good for:**
- Creating custom logic skills
- Building workflow-specific skills
- Interactive skill authoring

---

### What skill-creator Would Do (What We Need!)

**Purpose:** Create CUSTOM skills following best practices

**Process:**
```
User describes need → Interactive Q&A → Generate structure → Create files → Validate
```

**Output:** Custom skills for YOUR specific workflows

**Good for:**
- Creating Jarvis-specific skills
- Building AI Image Generator skills
- Custom business logic skills
- Following Anthropic best practices

**Perfect for our needs!**

---

## The skill-creator Skill Design

### SKILL.md Structure

```yaml
---
name: skill-creator
description: Create well-formed Claude Code skills following Anthropic best practices. Use when building new skills, need skill templates, or want to ensure proper SKILL.md format. Guides through YAML frontmatter, description optimization, file structure, and validation.
---

# Skill Creator

Create high-quality Claude Code skills following Anthropic's official best practices.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Creating a new skill from scratch
- Need to format SKILL.md properly
- Want description optimized for discovery
- Building multi-file skills with references
- Ensuring YAML frontmatter valid
- Following progressive disclosure patterns

## Instructions

When user requests skill creation:

### 1. Gather Requirements

Ask these questions:
- What should the skill do? (core purpose)
- When should Claude use it? (trigger contexts)
- Does it need code? (Python scripts, helpers)
- Does it need references? (documentation, examples)
- Personal or project skill? (location)

### 2. Generate Skill Name

**Rules from Anthropic:**
- Lowercase only
- Use hyphens, not underscores
- Max 64 characters
- Use gerund form (verb+ing) for action skills
- Be specific, not generic

**Examples:**
✅ analyzing-twitter-threads
✅ creating-linkedin-posts
✅ generating-youtube-scripts
❌ twitter-analyzer (use gerund)
❌ LinkedIn_Posts (no uppercase/underscores)
❌ helper (too generic)

### 3. Craft Description (CRITICAL!)

**Requirements:**
- Max 1024 characters
- Include WHAT it does
- Include WHEN to use it
- Add trigger keywords
- Be specific with examples

**Template:**
```
[What it does]. Use when [trigger context 1], [trigger context 2],
or [trigger context 3]. [Optional: Key capabilities or methods mentioned].
```

**Example - Good:**
```yaml
description: Analyze Twitter thread structure, engagement patterns, hook effectiveness, and viral elements using proven thread formulas. Use when analyzing tweets, Twitter threads, engagement metrics, or thread strategy. Includes Typefully methodology and viral thread breakdowns.
```

**Example - Bad:**
```yaml
description: For Twitter
```

### 4. Design File Structure

**Simple skill (most common):**
```
skill-name/
└── SKILL.md
```

**Medium complexity:**
```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md
├── prompts/
│   ├── template-1.md
│   └── template-2.md
└── examples/
    └── example-output.md
```

**Complex skill:**
```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md
├── reference/
│   ├── methodology.md
│   └── best-practices.md
├── prompts/
│   └── generation-templates.md
├── examples/
│   └── sample-outputs.md
└── scripts/
    ├── helper.py
    └── validator.py
```

**Rule:** Start simple, add complexity only when needed

### 5. Generate SKILL.md Content

**Required sections:**
```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: [Well-crafted description]
---

# Skill Name

## When to Use This Skill

[Specific trigger scenarios]

## Instructions

[Step-by-step guidance for Claude]

## Examples

[Concrete examples]

## Reference Files

[Links to bundled files if any]
```

**Optional sections:**
- Quick Reference
- Common Patterns
- Integration Notes
- Version History

### 6. Add Supporting Files

**If skill needs prompts:**
Create prompts/ directory with templates

**If skill needs examples:**
Create examples/ with concrete outputs

**If skill needs code:**
Create scripts/ with executable helpers

**If skill needs docs:**
Create reference/ with methodology guides

**Reference from SKILL.md:**
```markdown
For prompt templates, see [prompts/template.md](prompts/template.md).
Run helper: `python scripts/helper.py input.txt`
```

### 7. Validate

**Check YAML frontmatter:**
- Opening --- on line 1
- Closing --- before content
- name: lowercase-with-hyphens
- description: max 1024 chars
- No tabs, proper indentation

**Check file paths:**
- Unix-style forward slashes
- Relative paths from skill directory
- No absolute paths

**Check description quality:**
- Includes what + when
- Has trigger keywords
- Specific, not vague
- Max 1024 chars

### 8. Save to Location

**Ask user:**
```
Where to save this skill?

1. Personal (~/.claude/skills/skill-name/)
   - Available across all your projects
   - Your individual use

2. Project (.claude/skills/category/skill-name/)
   - Shared via git
   - Team access
   - Recommend category: [jarvis | ai-image-generator | research]

Select: [1/2]
```

**Create directories:**
```bash
mkdir -p {selected_location}
```

**Save SKILL.md and supporting files**

### 9. Test Recommendation

**Provide test query:**
```
Skill created! Test it with:

"{example query that should trigger this skill}"

If Claude mentions using your skill, it's working!
If not, the description may need more specific triggers.
```

## Reference Documentation

This skill includes Anthropic official best practices:

- **reference/anthropic-best-practices.md** - Official guidelines
- **reference/description-examples.md** - Good vs bad descriptions
- **reference/naming-conventions.md** - Gerund form, lowercase rules
- **examples/simple-skill.md** - Minimal skill example
- **examples/complex-skill.md** - Multi-file skill example

## Quality Checklist

Every generated skill should have:
- [ ] Valid YAML frontmatter
- [ ] Lowercase hyphenated name (gerund form if action)
- [ ] Description with what + when + triggers
- [ ] Clear instructions section
- [ ] At least one example

- `video-script-writer` - Could create skills for video formats

**Example composition:**
```
User: "Create a skill for LinkedIn carousel posts"
  → skill-creator guides creation
  → deep-web-research finds LinkedIn carousel best practices
  → skill-creator incorporates findings into skill
  → Result: Well-researched, properly-formatted skill
```

## Benefits Over workflow/Agent

### Why Skill > Workflow for This

**Skill advantages:**
1. **Auto-loads** - Just say "create a skill", it activates
2. **Simpler** - No state management needed
3. **Reusable** - Works across any context
4. **Composable** - Can work with research skills
5. **Follows own pattern** - Skill that creates skills (meta!)

**Workflow would require:**
- Explicit invocation (/skill-creator)
- State management (overkill)
- User must remember to invoke
- More complex for same result

**For one-shot skill creation, Skill is perfect!**

---

### Why Skill > Agent

**Agent would require:**
- Slash command (/skill-creator)
- Agent manifest
- Menu system
- Multiple workflows
- Way more code

**For skill creation, that's overkill!**

**skill-creator SKILL:**
- One SKILL.md file
- Auto-loads when relevant
- Does the job perfectly

**Simpler = better!**

---

## Addressing Your Concerns

### "skill-seeker is concerning me"

**You're right to be concerned!**

**skill-seeker issues:**
1. ❌ Too slow (1 page/hour with multi-source)
2. ❌ Buggy with unified configs
3. ❌ Wrong purpose (documentation scraping)
4. ❌ Not for creating custom skills
5. ❌ Doesn't follow Anthropic best practices

**skill-seeker is for:**
- Scraping React docs → create React skill
- Scraping YouTube guides → create YouTube skill
- Multi-source documentation aggregation

**skill-seeker is NOT for:**
- Creating custom logic skills
- Building Jarvis-specific skills
- Following Anthropic skill authoring best practices

---

### What We Actually Need

**For documentation scraping:** Keep skill-seeker (but use Firecrawl instead!)

**For creating custom skills:** Build skill-creator SKILL!

**Two different jobs, two different tools!**

---

## The skill-creator Skill Implementation

### Phase 1: Create the Skill (30 min)

**Create:**
```
.claude/skills/jarvis/skill-creator/
├── SKILL.md
├── reference/
│   ├── anthropic-best-practices.md
│   ├── description-optimization.md
│   └── progressive-disclosure-guide.md
├── examples/
│   ├── simple-skill.md
│   ├── medium-skill.md
│   └── complex-skill.md

- Validation rules

---

### Phase 2: Add Best Practices (30 min)

**reference/anthropic-best-practices.md:**
```markdown
# Anthropic Skill Best Practices

## Naming (From Official Docs)
- Lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens only
- Max 64 characters
- Use gerund form (verb+ing) for action skills
- Be specific, not generic

Examples:

- Level 2: SKILL.md body (loaded when relevant)
- Level 3: Bundled files (loaded on-demand)

Keep SKILL.md lean, move details to bundled files.

## File Structure
Simple:
skill-name/SKILL.md only

Medium:
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md
└── prompts/templates.md

Complex:
skill-name/

├── reference/methodology.md
├── prompts/
└── scripts/helper.py

Rule: Start simple!
```

---

### Phase 3: Add Templates (30 min)

**templates/SKILL-template.md:**
```yaml
---
name: {skill-name}
description: {what-it-does}. Use when {trigger-context}. {key-capabilities}.
---

# {Skill Display Name}

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- {trigger scenario 1}
- {trigger scenario 2}
- {trigger scenario 3}

## Instructions

{example output}

## Reference Files

- **[reference.md](reference.md)** - {description}
- **[prompts/template.md](prompts/template.md)** - {description}

## Integration

Works with:
- `{related-skill-1}` - {how they work together}
- `{related-skill-2}` - {how they work together}
```

---

### Phase 4: Add Validation (30 min)

**scripts/validate-skill.py:**
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""Validate SKILL.md follows Anthropic best practices"""

import re
import yaml

def validate_skill(skill_path):
    """Validate skill structure and content"""

    with open(f"{skill_path}/SKILL.md") as f:
        content = f.read()

    # Check YAML frontmatter
    if not content.startswith('---\n'):
        return "❌ Missing opening ---"

    # Extract YAML
    parts = content.split('---\n')
    if len(parts) < 3:
        return "❌ Missing closing ---"

    try:
        metadata = yaml.safe_load(parts[1])
    except:
        return "❌ Invalid YAML syntax"

    # Validate name
    if 'name' not in metadata:
        return "❌ Missing 'name' field"

    name = metadata['name']
    if not re.match(r'^[a-z0-9-]+$', name):
        return "❌ Name must be lowercase with hyphens only"

    if len(name) > 64:
        return "❌ Name too long (max 64 chars)"

    # Validate description
    if 'description' not in metadata:
        return "❌ Missing 'description' field"

    desc = metadata['description']
    if len(desc) > 1024:
        return "❌ Description too long (max 1024 chars)"

    if len(desc) < 50:
        return "⚠️  Description short - add more trigger keywords"

    # Check for what + when
    if 'use when' not in desc.lower() and 'when' not in desc.lower():
        return "⚠️  Description should include WHEN to use skill"

    return "✅ Skill valid!"

# Usage: python scripts/validate-skill.py path/to/skill
```

## Using the skill-creator Skill

### Example 1: Create Simple Skill

**User:** "Create a skill for writing Instagram captions"

**skill-creator activates:**
```
Using skill-creator skill...

**Skill Name:** creating-instagram-captions
(Following gerund naming convention)

**Description:**
"Create engaging Instagram captions with hooks, storytelling, and CTAs.
Use when writing Instagram posts, captions, or social media content for
Instagram. Applies proven engagement patterns and hashtag strategies."

Triggers: Instagram, captions, social media, posts
Max length: 184/1024 ✓

**Structure:** Simple (SKILL.md only)
No code needed for caption generation.

**Save to:** .claude/skills/jarvis/creating-instagram-captions/

Creating files...
✅ Created SKILL.md (3.2 KB)
✅ Validated YAML ✓
✅ Description optimized ✓

Test with: "Write an Instagram caption about productivity tips"
```

**Result:** Skill ready in 30 seconds!

---

### Example 2: Create Complex Skill

**User:** "Create a skill for analyzing financial statements with ratio calculations"

**skill-creator activates:**
```
Using skill-creator skill...

This requires code execution. I'll create a comprehensive structure.

**Skill Name:** analyzing-financial-statements

**Description:**
"Analyze financial statements, calculate key ratios (P/E, ROE, debt-to-equity),
and generate insights. Use when analyzing balance sheets, income statements,
cash flow, or financial data. Includes ratio calculator scripts and industry
benchmarks."

**Structure:** Complex
├── SKILL.md (core instructions)
├── reference/
│   ├── financial-ratios.md (ratio definitions)
│   └── industry-benchmarks.md (comparison data)
├── prompts/
│   └── analysis-template.md (structured output)
└── scripts/
    ├── ratio-calculator.py (deterministic calculations)
    └── validate-data.py (data validation)

**Creating files...**
✅ SKILL.md with progressive disclosure structure
✅ reference/financial-ratios.md (15 key ratios)
✅ scripts/ratio-calculator.py (tested formulas)
✅ All validated ✓

Test with: "Analyze this financial statement: [data]"
```

**Result:** Production-ready financial analysis skill!

---

## Comparison: skill-seeker vs skill-creator

### skill-seeker (Documentation Scraper)

**Input:** Config JSON with URLs
**Process:** Scrape website → Extract content → Create SKILL.md
**Output:** Reference skill based on documentation
**Time:** Minutes to hours (depending on page count)
**Best for:** Creating skills from existing docs

**Example use:**
```
skill-seeker scrape_docs --config configs/react-docs.json
→ Creates react-reference skill from React documentation
```

---

### skill-creator (Custom Skill Builder)

**Input:** Conversational description of need
**Process:** Interactive Q&A → Generate structure → Create files
**Output:** Custom skill following best practices
**Time:** Seconds to minutes (one-shot creation)
**Best for:** Creating NEW custom skills

**Example use:**
```
User: "Create a skill for writing product descriptions"
→ skill-creator auto-loads
→ Asks questions
→ Generates skill
→ Done!
```

---

## Both Tools Have a Place!

### Use skill-seeker When:
- ✅ Documentation exists online (React, YouTube, APIs)
- ✅ Want to create reference skills
- ✅ Multi-source aggregation needed
- ✅ Building knowledge base from websites

### Use skill-creator When:
- ✅ Creating custom logic skills
- ✅ Building workflow-specific capabilities
- ✅ Need Anthropic best practices enforced
- ✅ Want interactive skill authoring
- ✅ Building business-specific skills

**Different jobs, different tools!**

---

## Implementation Plan

### Option A: Build Minimal skill-creator (RECOMMENDED)

**Effort:** 2-3 hours
**Deliverable:** Working skill-creator skill

**Includes:**
- SKILL.md with creation guidance
- reference/anthropic-best-practices.md
- templates/SKILL-template.md
- examples/ (2-3 examples)
- scripts/validate-skill.py

**Result:** Can create good skills immediately

---

### Option B: Build Comprehensive skill-creator

**Effort:** 6-8 hours
**Deliverable:** Production-grade skill creation system

**Adds to Option A:**
- Multiple templates (simple, medium, complex)
- Interactive questionnaire system
- Automatic best practice checking
- Integration with skill-seeker (for references)
- Skill marketplace integration

**Result:** Industrial-strength skill authoring

---

### Option C: Use Anthropic's skill-creator

**Effort:** 0 hours (already exists!)
**Deliverable:** Access to Anthropic's skill-creator

**How:**
- Use Claude.ai Pro/Max/Team
- skill-creator already available
- Just ask Claude to create skills
- Follows official best practices

**Limitation:** Only in Claude.ai, not Claude Code (yet?)

---

## The Master's Recommendation

### Build Minimal skill-creator Skill (Option A)

**Why:**
- ✅ 2-3 hours effort (manageable)
- ✅ Solves immediate need
- ✅ Follows Anthropic pattern (they did same thing!)
- ✅ Model-invoked (auto-loads)
- ✅ Can iterate and improve later
- ✅ References official docs we already have

**Implementation:**
1. Create skill-creator/SKILL.md (1 hour)
2. Add reference docs from agent-skills.md (30 min)
3. Create templates and examples (1 hour)
4. Add validation script (30 min)
5. Test with 2-3 skill creations (30 min)

**Total: 3.5 hours**

**Result:** Can create good skills going forward!

---

### Then Use It To Create More Skills

**With skill-creator, you can easily build:**

**High-value skills to create:**
1. **creating-linkedin-posts** - LinkedIn-specific (extract from write-posts)
2. **creating-twitter-threads** - Thread-specific (extract from write-posts)
3. **analyzing-viral-content** - Social media analysis
4. **optimizing-video-retention** - Retention tactics (extract from write-scripts)
5. **formatting-platform-content** - All platform specs (extract from write-posts Step 4)

**Each skill creation: ~5 minutes with skill-creator!**

**Without skill-creator: ~30-60 min per skill (manual formatting, validation)**

**ROI:** 3.5 hours investment → saves 6-10 hours on next 10 skills!

---

---

### Regarding skill-seeker

**Keep it for:** Documentation scraping
**But use Firecrawl for speed!**
**Don't use for:** Custom skill authoring

**skill-seeker purpose:**
- Scrape Anthropic docs → anthropic-context-engineering skill
- Scrape Exa docs → exa-search-api-docs skill
- Scrape YouTube guides → youtube-thumbnails-unified skill

**skill-creator purpose:**
- Create custom Jarvis skills
- Create AI Image Generator skills
- Create business logic skills

**Both have a place!**
