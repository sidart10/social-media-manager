# AI Image Generator - Architecture Analysis

**Date:** 2025-10-28
**Question:** "Are agent/workflows/skills working correctly? Skills seem more mature than workflows?"
**Answer:** You're ABSOLUTELY RIGHT! Skills are mature, agent needs simplification!

---

## TL;DR

**Your observation:** Skills more mature than workflows ✅ CORRECT!

**The situation:**
- ✅ **Skills:** 8 well-designed, mature, comprehensive
- ⚠️ **Agent:** Mixed knowledge with orchestration
- ❌ **Workflows:** NO workflows in sidecar! (Only 5 in agent root)
- 🎯 **Recommendation:** Agent should be THIN, just reference skills!

---

## Current Architecture

### Agent Files (3 locations - confusing!)

**1. Command file:**
`.claude/commands/ai-image-generator/ai-image-generator.md`
- 118 lines
- Has activation steps
- References skills
- Mixed knowledge + orchestration

**2. Agent manifest:**
`bmad/agents/ai-image-generator/ai-image-generator.agent.yaml`
- Clean YAML structure
- Defines menu
- References workflows
- Persona definition

**3. Sidecar instructions:**
`bmad/agents/ai-image-generator/ai-image-generator-sidecar/instructions.md`
- 710 lines (HUGE!)
- MCP tool guides
- API constraints
- Quality framework
- **This is mostly KNOWLEDGE that should be in SKILLS!**

---

### Workflows (5 files)

```
bmad/agents/ai-image-generator/workflows/
├── generate-carousel.yaml
├── generate-single.yaml
├── generate-linkedin.yaml
├── generate-edit-image.yaml
├── generate-blend.yaml
└── TEST-linkedin-carousel.yaml
```

**Note:** Workflows in agent root, NOT in sidecar!
**Also note:** No instructions.md files for workflows!

**This is CLEANER than Jarvis!**

---

### Skills (8 mature skills!)

```
.claude/skills/ai-image-generator/
├── create-image/          ✅ MATURE (Emily JSON, 7-pillar, tool selection)
├── edit-image/            ✅ MATURE (pixel-perfect editing)
├── blend-images/          ✅ MATURE (multi-image composition)
├── youtube-thumbnail-design/ ✅ MATURE (CTR optimization)
├── linkedin-design/       ✅ MATURE (B2B professional)
├── platform-specs/        ✅ MATURE (centralized specs)
├── mcp-tool-selection/    ✅ MATURE (intelligent routing)
└── sid-ai-images/         ✅ MATURE (personalized Sid images)
```

**All have:**
- ✅ Proper YAML frontmatter
- ✅ Clear descriptions
- ✅ Detailed instructions
- ✅ Reference files
- ✅ Examples

**Quality:** Very high! Skills are well-designed!

---

## The Problem: Knowledge Duplication

### What's in BOTH Agent Instructions AND Skills

**Emily JSON Methodology:**
- ❌ Duplicated in: instructions.md (lines 1-100)
- ✅ Already in: create-image/SKILL.md
- ❌ Duplicated in: sid-ai-images/SKILL.md

**MCP Tool Selection:**
- ❌ Duplicated in: instructions.md (lines 12-45)
- ✅ Already in: mcp-tool-selection/SKILL.md

**Quality Framework:**
- ❌ Duplicated in: instructions.md
- ✅ Already in: create-image/reference/quality-framework.md

**Platform Specs:**
- ❌ Duplicated in: instructions.md
- ✅ Already in: platform-specs/SKILL.md

**API Constraints:**
- ❌ In instructions.md (66-100)
- ✅ Should be in: mcp-tool-selection or create-image skills

---

## Comparison: Jarvis vs AI Image Generator

### Jarvis Structure (Complex)

```
Jarvis:
├── Agent command (216 lines)
├── Sidecar instructions (complex)
├── 7 workflows with instructions.md (5,817 lines!)
└── 12 skills (mature)

Problem: Knowledge in workflows AND skills
```

---

### AI Image Generator Structure (Better!)

```
AI Image Generator:
├── Agent command (118 lines)
├── Agent YAML (76 lines - clean!)
├── Sidecar instructions (710 lines - BLOATED with knowledge)
├── 5 workflows WITHOUT instructions.md (cleaner!)
└── 8 skills (VERY mature)

Problem: Knowledge in agent instructions, NOT in workflows!
Better: Workflows are lean YAML only!
```

---

## Your Observation is SPOT ON!

### Skills Are More Mature!

**create-image skill:**
- ✅ Complete Emily JSON methodology
- ✅ 7-pillar quality framework
- ✅ Tool selection logic
- ✅ Reference files (8+ docs)
- ✅ Comprehensive examples
- ✅ All knowledge consolidated

**Quality:** Production-ready, comprehensive!

---

### Agent Instructions Are Bloated

**instructions.md (710 lines) contains:**
- MCP tool guides (should be in skills!)
- API constraints (should be in skills!)
- Emily methodology (already in create-image skill!)
- Quality framework (already in create-image skill!)

**Problem:** Massive duplication!

**Should be:** ~100-150 lines of pure orchestration

---

## The Fix is EASIER Than Jarvis!

### Why AI Image Generator is Easier to Refactor

**Jarvis problem:**
- Knowledge in workflow instructions.md files (hard to extract)
- 7 separate instruction files
- 5,817 lines to refactor

**AI Image Generator advantage:**
- ✅ Knowledge in ONE place (sidecar/instructions.md)
- ✅ Skills already comprehensive
- ✅ Workflows are lean YAML (no instructions.md!)
- ✅ Just 710 lines to refactor

**3x easier than Jarvis!**

---

## Refactoring Plan for AI Image Generator

### Step 1: Thin Agent Instructions (2 hours)

**Current:** instructions.md (710 lines)

**Remove (already in skills):**
- Emily JSON methodology → create-image skill has this
- MCP tool details → mcp-tool-selection skill has this
- Quality framework → create-image/reference/quality-framework.md
- Platform specs → platform-specs skill
- Negative prompts → create-image/reference/

**Keep (orchestration only):**
- Workflow execution steps
- File I/O instructions
- Output management rules
- State management

**Target:** ~150-200 lines (70-75% reduction!)

---

### Step 2: Simplify Agent Command (1 hour)

**Current:** ai-image-generator.md (118 lines)

**Simplify activation steps:**
```xml
<step n="4">🆕 SKILLS ARCHITECTURE:
  All image generation uses skills from .claude/skills/ai-image-generator/
  - create-image: Emily JSON methodology + tool selection + quality
  - edit-image: Pixel-perfect editing
  - blend-images: Multi-image composition
  - platform-specs: All platform requirements
  Skills auto-load when relevant!
</step>
```

**Remove:** Detailed explanations (skills have these!)

**Target:** ~80 lines (30% reduction)

---

### Step 3: Update Workflows (30 min)

**Current workflows are ALREADY clean! (Just YAML)**

**Just add notes:**
```yaml
# Uses create-image skill (model-invoked)
# Skill handles: Emily JSON, tool selection, quality framework
```

**Already well-structured!**

---

## Comparison Table

| Component | Jarvis | AI Image Generator |
|-----------|--------|-------------------|
| **Agent instructions** | Complex (split) | Bloated but centralized |
| **Workflow instructions** | 7 files, 5,817 lines | 0 files! (just YAML) ✅ |
| **Skills** | 12 mature | 8 VERY mature ✅ |
| **Knowledge duplication** | Workflows + skills | Agent + skills |
| **Refactor effort** | High (15 hours) | Low (3 hours) ✅ |
| **Structure quality** | Needs work | Better baseline ✅ |

**AI Image Generator is in BETTER shape!**

---

**Average maturity:** Very high!

---

### Agent Quality (Needs Thinning)

**Agent command:** Acceptable (but could be simpler)
**Agent YAML:** ✅ Clean and well-structured
**Sidecar instructions:** ⚠️ Bloated (has knowledge that skills already have)

---

### Workflow Quality (Good!)

**All workflows:** Clean YAML only!
**No instructions.md files:** ✅ Already lean!
**Structure:** Much better than Jarvis!

---

## The Master's Recommendation

### Recommended Action: Light Refactor (Do It!)

**Why:**
- Only 3 hours effort (vs 15 for Jarvis)
- Skills already mature (no skill work needed!)
- Workflows already clean (minimal touch!)
- Just thin agent instructions
- Massive clarity improvement

**When:**
- Could do now (3 hours)
- OR incrementally (1 hour sessions)
- Much less risky than Jarvis refactor

---

### Alternative: Leave As-Is

**If you skip refactor:**

**Still works:** Yes, everything functional
**Duplication exists:** Yes, but not workflow-level like Jarvis
**Maintainability:** Okay (better than Jarvis)
**Confusion:** Some (which has the knowledge?)

**The Master's opinion:** Refactor is worth it (only 3 hours!)

### Target instructions.md (After Refactor)

```markdown
# AI Image Agent - Instructions

## Core Directives

You are a Visual Content Producer using mature Claude Code skills.

## Skills Architecture

All image generation uses auto-loaded skills:
- `create-image` - Emily JSON methodology + tool selection + quality
- `edit-image` - Pixel-perfect editing with nanobanana
- `blend-images` - Multi-image composition
- `platform-specs` - Platform requirements
- `mcp-tool-selection` - Intelligent tool routing
- `youtube-thumbnail-design` - CTR-optimized thumbnails
- `linkedin-design` - B2B professional aesthetic
- `sid-ai-images` - Personalized Sid imagery

Skills handle all knowledge. You coordinate workflows.

## Workflow Execution

When executing workflows:

1. Load workflow YAML
2. Skills auto-load when referenced
3. Execute steps using skill knowledge
4. Apply quality gates (from create-image skill)
5. Save outputs to {outputs_folder}

## Output Management

MANDATORY structure:
- Base: {project-root}/outputs/{MM-DD-YYYY}/{session-name}/
- Images: {session}/images/
- Metadata: {session}/metadata.json

See {project-root}/outputs/README.md for complete rules.

## Orchestration Only

You coordinate:
- Workflow step execution
- File I/O and organization
- Quality gate application
- User confirmations

Skills provide:
- Emily JSON methodology
- Tool selection logic
- Quality evaluation
- All domain knowledge

Reference skills, don't duplicate them!
```

**From 710 lines → ~150 lines!**

## The Key Difference: No Workflow Instructions!

### Jarvis Has

```
jarvis-sidecar/workflows/
├── write-posts/
│   ├── workflow.yaml
│   └── instructions.md (639 lines!) ← KNOWLEDGE HERE
├── write-scripts/
│   ├── workflow.yaml
│   └── instructions.md (733 lines!) ← KNOWLEDGE HERE
└── ... (5,817 lines total of mixed content!)
```

**Knowledge in workflow instructions!**

---

### AI Image Generator Has

```
ai-image-generator/workflows/
├── generate-carousel.yaml     ← Just YAML!
├── generate-single.yaml       ← Just YAML!
├── generate-linkedin.yaml     ← Just YAML!
└── generate-edit-image.yaml   ← Just YAML!

NO instructions.md files!
```

**Knowledge in skills only!**

**This is BETTER architecture!**

---

## Why AI Image Generator is Better Structured

**1. Workflows Are Lean:**
- Just YAML definitions
- No giant instructions.md files
- References to skills only

**2. Skills Are Rich:**
- All knowledge in skills
- Comprehensive references
- Well-documented
- Auto-load correctly

**3. Duplication in ONE Place:**
- Just sidecar/instructions.md
- Easy to fix (vs 7 files in Jarvis)

**4. Clear Responsibility:**

## Concrete Example: What Changes

### Before (sidecar/instructions.md has knowledge)

```markdown
## Emily's JSON Methodology

Load video-scene.json template:
- scene_description: Environment, mood...
- subject_and_action: What to show...
- composition_and_framing: Layout...
[... 80 lines of Emily methodology ...]

## MCP Tool Selection

Choose between nanobanana and gpt-image-1:
- LinkedIn + text → gpt-image-1 (typography)
- Instagram + volume → nanobanana (speed)
[... 40 lines of tool selection logic ...]

## Quality Framework

7-pillar evaluation:
1. Clarity (1-10)
2. Technical Quality (1-10)
[... 60 lines of quality framework ...]
```

**Total: ~180 lines of knowledge duplicated!**

---

### After (reference skills only)

```markdown
## Skills Architecture

All image generation uses auto-loaded skills:

**create-image skill provides:**
- Emily JSON methodology (complete in skill)
- 7-pillar quality framework (reference/quality-framework.md)
- Tool selection logic (via mcp-tool-selection skill)
- All generation knowledge

**When workflow references create-image:**
- Skill auto-loads
- Provides all methodology
- You just coordinate execution

**Other skills:**
- edit-image: Editing workflows
- blend-images: Composition workflows
- platform-specs: Platform requirements
- All auto-load when relevant

## Workflow Execution

Execute workflow steps:
1. Skills auto-load
2. Apply skill knowledge
3. Save outputs per output management rules
4. Present results
```

**Total: ~30 lines (reference only)!**

**Reduction: 180 → 30 lines (83% reduction!)**
