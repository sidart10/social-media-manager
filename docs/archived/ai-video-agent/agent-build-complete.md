## 🚀 Ready to Use

### How to Activate

The agent is ready but needs to be compiled from YAML to MD (XML) format for Claude to use.

**Option 1: If you have BMAD build tools**:

```bash
# Run the BMAD installer/compiler
# It will convert .agent.yaml → .md
```

**Option 2: Manual activation**:
The agent YAML is ready and can be used by tools that support the BMAD agent format.

### First Steps

1. **Test MCP Servers**:

```bash
claude mcp list
# Should show: heygen ✓ Connected, veo ✓ Connected
```

2. **Activate Agent**:

```
Call: ai-video-agent
```

3. **Setup Avatars** (first time):

```
Command: *setup-avatars
```

4. **Generate First Video**:

```
Command: *reels
# Follow the prompts
```

## 📊 Platform Intelligence Built-In

The agent knows exactly what each platform needs:

### Instagram Reels

- 9:16 vertical
- Hook @ 1.5 seconds
- Captions mandatory
- 30-60s sweet spot

### YouTube Shorts

- 9:16 vertical
- Hook @ 3 seconds
- <60 seconds
- Retention critical

### TikTok

- 9:16 vertical
- Hook @ 1 second (fastest)
- 7-15s = peak engagement
- Sound/music critical

### YouTube Standard

- 16:9 landscape
- Hook @ 8 seconds
- 8+ minutes ideal
- Chapters recommended

---

## 🛡️ Safety Features

### Consent Verification

- **BLOCKS** un-consented HeyGen avatars
- Requires explicit consent setup
- Consent artifacts stored in `/consent/`

### Cost Controls

- **Auto-estimates** before every generation
- **Safety limit**: $5.00 per video (configurable)
- **Approval required** for costs > $1.00

### Watermark Preservation

- **NEVER strips** C2PA metadata
- Preserves provenance watermarks
- Legal compliance enforced

## 🎬 Example Usage

### Talking Head for Instagram Reels

```
User: *reels

Agent: "What platform is this for?"
User: reels

Agent: "Instagram Reels - 9:16 vertical, hook @ 1.5s critical.
        Here are your avatars: [list]"
User: [picks avatar]

Agent: "Which voice?"
User: [picks voice]

Agent: "What's your script?"
User: [provides script]

Agent: "Estimated 30 seconds. Hook in first 1.5s - what's your
        attention-grabber?"
User: [describes hook]

Agent: "Captions ON by default (80% watch muted). Generate for ~$0.40?"
User: y

Agent: "✓ Job queued. Rendering... [progress updates]"
        "✅ Video ready! [URL]"
```

## 🔄 Workflow Status

### Fully Implemented ✅

- Talking head generation (HeyGen)
- Scene generation (Veo)
- Platform optimization
- Cost estimation
- Consent verification (logic)
- Metadata logging

### Workflow Placeholders 🔜

These commands exist but workflows need to be built:

- `*create-montage` - Image stitching
- `*create-hybrid` - Mixed media
- `*test-hooks` - A/B testing
- `*setup-avatars` - Consent UI

You can build these workflows following the same pattern as talking-head and scene generation.

---

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

Before production use:

- [ ] Test HeyGen avatar listing: `mcp__heygen__list_avatars`
- [ ] Test Veo generation: `*create-scene` with simple prompt
- [ ] Verify cost estimates are accurate
- [ ] Check metadata JSON is saved correctly
- [ ] Test platform specs loading
- [ ] Verify consent blocking works
- [ ] Test queue status display

---

## 📈 Next Steps

### Immediate

1. Activate and test the agent
2. Generate your first talking head video
3. Generate a Veo scene
4. Verify outputs and metadata

### Short Term

1. Build remaining workflow placeholders
2. Create consent setup UI
3. Test all platform quick commands
4. Refine cost estimations with real data
