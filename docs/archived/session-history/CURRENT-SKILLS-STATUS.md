## 🎯 COMPLETION PLAN

**Phase 1: Complete MCP Skills (2 hours) - CRITICAL**

These NEED reference/ folders because they call MCPs:

1. ✅ social-media-research (DONE - 850 lines)
2. ⏳ profile-analysis (need 30-45 min)
   - reference/apify-tools.md
   - reference/platform-guides.md
   - reference/cost-examples.md

3. ⏳ youtube-research (need 20 min)
   - reference/youtube-transcript-tool.md
   - reference/analysis-patterns.md

4. ⏳ deep-web-research (need 30 min)
   - reference/exa-tools.md
   - reference/research-strategies.md

---

**Phase 2: Processing Skills (1 hour) - OPTIONAL**

These might work as-is since they don't call MCPs:

5. research-synthesizer (may enhance)
6. voice-matcher (likely fine)
7. platform-formatter (likely fine - already detailed)
8. evidence-tracker (likely fine)

---

## 📊 Summary

**Enhanced:** 1/8 Skills (social-media-research)
**Need Enhancement:** 3/8 Skills (MCP-calling Skills)
**Optional:** 4/8 Skills (processing Skills)

**Next:** Create reference/ for profile-analysis, youtube-research, deep-web-research

---

**Want me to create reference/ for the other 3 MCP Skills now?** (1.5 hours total)

This will give all MCP-invoking Skills the comprehensive documentation they need!
