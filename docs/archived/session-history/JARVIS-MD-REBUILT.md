# jarvis.md - Rebuilt

**Issue:** jarvis.md file was missing/corrupted in .claude/commands/jarvis/

**Fix:**

1. Rebuilt from source: `node tools/cli/bmad-cli.js build --all`
2. Copied to: `.claude/commands/jarvis/jarvis.md`

**Now:** Fresh, working jarvis.md file with correct paths

**Restart Claude Code and /jarvis should work!**
