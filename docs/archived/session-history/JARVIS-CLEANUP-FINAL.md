# ✅ JARVIS - FINAL CLEAN ARCHITECTURE

**Date:** 2025-10-27
**Status:** Consolidated and Organized

---

## 🎯 CLEAN STRUCTURE (Like Other Agents)

### Main Agent Location:

```
bmad/agents/content-intelligence/
├── jarvis.agent.yaml          # Source
├── jarvis.md                  # Compiled
├── jarvis-sidecar/            # All resources
│   ├── config.yaml
│   ├── instructions.md
│   ├── memories.md
│   ├── workflows/             # 7 workflows
│   ├── knowledge/
│   ├── outputs/
│   ├── sessions/
│   └── test-results/
├── README.md
└── [docs - to be archived]
```

### Project Skills (NEW):

```
.claude/skills/jarvis/
├── social-media-research/SKILL.md
├── youtube-research/SKILL.md
├── profile-analysis/SKILL.md
├── deep-web-research/SKILL.md
├── research-synthesizer/SKILL.md
├── voice-matcher/SKILL.md
├── platform-formatter/SKILL.md
└── evidence-tracker/SKILL.md
```

### Compiled Command:

```
.claude/commands/jarvis/
├── jarvis.md (copy from main)
└── workflows/ (copies for access)
```

## ✅ WHAT WAS CLEANED

**Removed:**

- ❌ ~/.claude/skills/jarvis/ (moved to project .claude/skills/)
- ❌ bmad/agents/jarvis/ (duplicate - deleted)
- ❌ .claude/commands/jarvis/{templates}/ folders (empty/weird)
- ❌ Redundant files from .claude/commands/jarvis/ (8 files archived)

**Result:**

- ONE main location (bmad/agents/content-intelligence/)
- Skills in project (.claude/skills/jarvis/)
- Clean command folder
- No duplicates

---

## 📊 Comparison with Other Agents

**All agents now have consistent pattern:**

### ai-video-agent:

- bmad/agents/ai-video-agent/ (single location)
- No Skills (workflows call MCPs directly)

### ai-image-generator:

- bmad/agents/ai-image-generator/ (single location)
- No Skills (workflows call MCPs directly)

### Jarvis:

- bmad/agents/content-intelligence/ (single location)
- WITH Skills (.claude/skills/jarvis/) - autonomous MCP invocation
- **Same base structure, enhanced with Skills layer**

---

## 🎯 WHY SKILLS ARE IN SEPARATE FOLDER

**Claude Code Skills architecture:**

- Skills MUST be in `.claude/skills/` folder (project) OR `~/.claude/skills/` (global)
- This is where Claude looks for them
- Can't be in bmad/agents/ (Claude won't find them)

**But:**

- `.claude/skills/` IS in your project
- Git-tracked
- Team-shareable
- Just a different folder

**Think of it like:**

- bmad/agents/ = Agent definitions
- .claude/skills/ = Execution layer (Skills)
- Both in project, both tracked

---

## 🚀 READY TO TEST

**Restart Claude Code** to load Skills from new project location

**Structure is now:**

- ✅ Clean (no duplicates)
- ✅ Organized (logical locations)
- ✅ Consistent (like other agents but enhanced)
- ✅ Git-tracked (all in project)

**Test:**

```
/jarvis → research-topic
```

Skills will load from .claude/skills/jarvis/ (project-level)!

**Architecture is now clean! Ready to test!** 🚀
