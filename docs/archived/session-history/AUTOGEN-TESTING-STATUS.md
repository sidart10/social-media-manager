# AutoGen Skill Testing - Current Status

**Date:** 2025-10-27
**Status:** In Progress - Template variable issues

---

## Issue Encountered

**Error:** Template string formatting issues with {variables} in prompts

**Root cause:**
- Prompts have {audience}, {objective}, {tone}, etc. as placeholders
- These need to be filled when creating agents
- Some variables like {facts}, {quotes} were meant as examples, not actual variables
- Python's .format() tries to fill ALL {xxx} patterns

---

## Fix Applied

**Created simplified prompts:**
- Removed complex template variables
- Kept prompts clear and direct
- No {xxx} patterns that cause formatting errors

**Files:**
- prompts_complex.py (original - has issues)
- prompts.py (simplified - should work)

---

## Next Steps

1. Test with simplified prompts
2. If works: Gradually add back parameters
3. If still fails: Debug AutoGen agent creation

**Multiple tests running in background...**
