## ðŸŽ¯ HOW WRITING STYLE WORKS

### Different Post Types & Styles

**The AutoGen system handles this via:**

#### For LinkedIn (Professional):
```python
platform = "linkedin"
tone = "professional and data-driven"
audience = "CTOs and engineering leaders"

â†’ Tone_Agent applies:
  - Professional language
  - Data-driven arguments
  - Formal structure
  - Industry terminology
```

#### For Twitter (Casual):
```python
platform = "twitter"
tone = "casual and conversational"
audience = "developers"

â†’ Tone_Agent applies:
  - Shorter sentences
  - Casual language
  - Direct communication
  - Dev-friendly terms
```

#### For Reels/TikTok (Engaging):
```python
platform = "reels"
tone = "MKBHD-style casual"
audience = "general tech enthusiasts"

â†’ Tone_Agent_Reel applies:
  - 8-word hook
  - Fast-paced content
  - Spoken English (um, like, you know)
  - Engaging CTA
```

---

### User Voice Profile Integration

**From learn-voice workflow:**
```
memories.md contains:
- Vocabulary level (simple/moderate/advanced)
- Sentence pattern (short/varied/flowing)
- Tone score (1-10, formal to casual)
- Signature phrases ("here's the thing", "super useful")
- Emoji usage (never/rare/moderate)
```

**AutoGen integration:**
```python
# Before generating, load voice profile
voice_profile = load_from_memories()

# Adjust Tone_Agent system message:
TONE_AGENT_PROMPT = f"""
    {base_prompt}

    CRITICAL: Match user's writing style:
    - Vocabulary: {voice_profile.vocab_level}
    - Sentence style: {voice_profile.sentence_pattern}
    - Tone: {voice_profile.tone_score}/10 casual
    - Use these phrases naturally: {voice_profile.signature_phrases}
    - Emoji usage: {voice_profile.emoji_pattern}
"""

# Now Tone_Agent generates in USER'S voice!
```

## ðŸ“Š RESEARCH â†’ WRITING DATA FLOW

### What Research Provides:

**From research-brief.md:**
```markdown
## Key Facts
- "73% of developers automate < 20% of workflows" (DevSurvey)
- "AI automation market growing 28% YoY" (TechCrunch)

## Hashtags
#AIAutomation #ProductivityTools #NoCode

## YouTube Examples
- "Start with one repetitive task" - @creator (2:34)
- Demo-heavy approach works best

## Gaps
- Nobody covers automation for designers
```

### How Writing Uses It:

**write-posts workflow:**
```
Idea Card #3: "5 AI Tools That Automate Your Workflows"
â†“
Loads research-brief.md
â†“
AutoGen Content_Agent uses:
  - Fact: "73% automate < 20%" â†’ Opening hook
  - Tools from research â†’ The 5 tools to feature
  - Quote: "Start with one task" â†’ Include in post
  - Hashtags: #AIAutomation â†’ Use in post
â†“
Generates LinkedIn post WITH evidence from research
```

**write-scripts workflow:**
```
Idea Card #2: "Why Most Developers Are Missing Out on Automation"
â†“
Loads research-brief.md
â†“
AutoGen agents use:
  - Stats from research â†’ 0:15 mark "Did you know 73%..."
  - YouTube examples â†’ Structure inspiration
  - Quotes â†’ 1:20 mark "As expert said..."
  - Gaps â†’ 2:00 mark "Here's what nobody talks about..."
â†“
Generates script WITH research-backed content
```
