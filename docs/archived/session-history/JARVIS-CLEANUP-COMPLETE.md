# ✅ Jarvis Command Folder - Cleanup Complete

**Date:** 2025-10-27
**Location:** `.claude/commands/jarvis/`

---

## What Was Cleaned

### Archived (Moved to .archive/jarvis-command-cleanup/):

- config.yaml (duplicate of jarvis-sidecar/config.yaml)
- instructions.md (duplicate of jarvis-sidecar/instructions.md)
- memories.md (duplicate of jarvis-sidecar/memories.md)
- knowledge/ (duplicate folder)
- outputs/ (duplicate folder)
- sessions/ (duplicate folder)
- FIXES-APPLIED.md (status doc)
- MCP-FIX-PLAN.md (status doc)

### Deleted:

- workflows/write-scripts/instructions 2.md (duplicate file)

### Updated:

- jarvis.md (copied latest from bmad/agents/content-intelligence/)

---

## Final Clean Structure

```
.claude/commands/jarvis/
├── jarvis.md       # Compiled agent (ONLY essential file)
├── workflows/      # All 7 simplified workflows (copied from jarvis-sidecar)
└── README.md       # Documentation
```

**Result:** Clean, organized, no redundancy!

---

## How It Works

**jarvis.md references:**

```
{agent-folder}/workflows/research-topic/workflow.yaml
```

**Where {agent-folder} resolves to:**

```
bmad/agents/content-intelligence/jarvis-sidecar/
```

**So workflows can be in either location - they'll be found!**

---

## Next Steps

1. **Restart Claude Code** (load cleaned structure)
2. **Test:** `/jarvis` → research-topic
3. **Should work** with Skills now!

---

**Cleanup complete - folder is now organized and minimal!** ✅
