**Date:** 2025-10-27
**Status:** Consolidated and Clean

**Deleted:**

- ❌ ~/.claude/skills/jarvis/ (was global, now project-level)
- ❌ bmad/agents/jarvis/ (was duplicate, removed)

---

## ✅ WHAT CHANGED

### 1. Skills Moved to Project ✨

**From:** `~/.claude/skills/jarvis/` (global/personal)
**To:** `.claude/skills/jarvis/` (project-level)

**Benefits:**

- ✅ Part of project (git-tracked)
- ✅ Team-shareable
- ✅ Version controlled
- ✅ Project-specific
- ✅ Still works! (Claude loads from .claude/skills/)

### 2. Duplicate Removed

**Deleted:** `bmad/agents/jarvis/` (old duplicate)

**Now:** Only ONE Jarvis location

- `bmad/agents/content-intelligence/` (all agent files)

### 3. Architecture Clarified

**Jarvis = BMAD Agent + Claude Skills:**

- Agent definition: bmad/agents/content-intelligence/
- Skills (execution layer): .claude/skills/jarvis/
- Compiled command: .claude/commands/jarvis/

---

## 📊 Comparison with Other Agents

### ai-video-agent (No Skills):

```
bmad/agents/ai-video-agent/
└── workflows/ call MCPs directly
```

### ai-image-generator (No Skills):

```
bmad/agents/ai-image-generator/
└── workflows/ call MCPs directly
```

### Jarvis (WITH Skills):

```
bmad/agents/content-intelligence/
└── workflows/ invoke Skills

.claude/skills/jarvis/
└── Skills call MCPs
```

**Jarvis is DIFFERENT** (uses Skills layer) but now properly organized!

---

## 🎯 Clean Structure Achieved

**Agent files:** ONE location (bmad/agents/content-intelligence/)
**Skills:** ONE location (.claude/skills/jarvis/)
**Command:** ONE location (.claude/commands/jarvis/)

**No duplicates, no confusion!**

---

## 🔄 RESTART & TEST

**Restart Claude Code** to load Skills from new location (.claude/skills/)

**Then test:**

```
/jarvis → research-topic
```

Skills will still invoke automatically from project location!

---

**Structure is now clean and makes sense!** ✅
