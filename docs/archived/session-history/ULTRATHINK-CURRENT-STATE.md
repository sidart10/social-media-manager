## üîç COMPLETE INVENTORY OF WORKING MCP SERVERS

### Currently Connected MCP Servers (Need Full List):

1. ‚úÖ apify - ALL platform scraping
2. ‚úÖ youtube-transcript - Video transcripts
3. ‚úÖ exa - Deep research
4. ‚úÖ social-media-mcp - Trending, research, **content generation**
5. ‚úÖ youtube-uploader-mcp - Connected (need to check capabilities)
6. ‚úÖ mcp_twitter - Connected (need to check capabilities)
7. ‚úÖ archon - Project management
8. ‚úÖ serena - Code navigation
9. ‚úÖ gpt-image-1 - Image generation
10. ‚úÖ nanobanana - Image generation
11. ‚úÖ heygen - Avatar videos
12. ‚úÖ sora2 - Video generation
13. ‚úÖ veo3 - Video generation
14. ‚úÖ chrome-devtools - Browser automation

### What EACH Server Can Actually Do:

**Need to research:**

1. **social-media-mcp** - Just installed, has 3 tools:
   - create_post (natural language ‚Üí posts)
   - get_trending_topics
   - research_topic (with Brave + Perplexity)
   - **INCLUDES CONTENT GENERATION!**

2. **youtube-uploader-mcp** - Connected, what can it do?
   - Upload videos obviously
   - But what else?
   - Does it have script features?

3. **mcp_twitter** - Connected, what can it do?
   - Post tweets
   - What else?

## üß† CRITICAL QUESTIONS TO ANSWER

### Question 1: Does social-media-mcp ALREADY handle content generation?

**From README:** "Content Generation: Generate engaging content using multiple AI models"

**Tools:**

- `create_post` - Creates posts with natural language
- Uses OpenAI/Anthropic under the hood
- Has content/strategies/ and content/templates/

**HYPOTHESIS:** We might not need script-generation-mcp at all!
social-media-mcp might already do content generation!

**Need to verify:**

- What does `create_post` actually generate?
- Can it generate scripts or just short posts?
- Can we use this instead of script-generation-mcp?

---

### Question 2: What does youtube-uploader-mcp provide?

**Known:** Uploads YouTube videos

**Unknown:**

- Does it have script generation tools?
- Does it have research tools?
- Does it have content tools?
- What tools does it expose?

**Need to check:**

- List tools from youtube-uploader-mcp
- Check its capabilities
- Might have exactly what we need!

---

### Question 3: What capabilities are we duplicating?

**Potential Overlaps:**

- social-media-mcp research vs exa research
- youtube-uploader-mcp vs youtube-transcript
- Content generation across multiple MCPs

**Need to understand:**

- What's the BEST tool for each job?
- Are we over-complicating?
- Can we simplify the workflow?

---

## üéØ WHAT I SHOULD DO (Not What I Did)

### Step 1: List ALL Tools from ALL MCPs (30 min)

```
For each connected MCP:
1. apify - what tools?
2. youtube-transcript - what tools?
3. exa - what tools?
4. social-media-mcp - what tools?
5. youtube-uploader-mcp - what tools?
6. mcp_twitter - what tools?
```

### Step 2: Map Tools to Workflow Needs (30 min)

```
For write-posts workflow, we need:
- Content generation
- Platform formatting
- Evidence injection

Which MCPs provide these?
- social-media-mcp? (has create_post with AI)
- mcp_twitter? (might have content tools)
- Something else we haven't checked?
```

### Step 3: Redesign Workflows Based on ACTUAL Capabilities (1 hour)

```
Not based on assumptions
Not based on rushed fixes
Based on WHAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE

Example:
If social-media-mcp can generate posts with natural language:
  ‚Üí Use that instead of OpenAI direct
If youtube-uploader-mcp has script tools:
  ‚Üí Use that for video scripts
```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è WHAT I WAS DOING WRONG

**Mistake 1:** Rushing to implement OpenAI direct API

- Without checking if social-media-mcp already does content generation
- Without checking other MCPs

**Mistake 2:** Assuming script-generation-mcp was critical

- It might not be! We might have better alternatives!
- social-media-mcp might do the same thing!

**Mistake 3:** Not fully analyzing what we have

- 14+ MCP servers connected
- Only analyzed 3 of them thoroughly
- Didn't check capabilities of the rest

---

## üéØ CORRECT NEXT STEPS

### Immediate (What I'll Do Now):

**1. List ALL Tools from Critical MCPs** (15 min)

- Check social-media-mcp tools (especially create_post)
- Check youtube-uploader-mcp tools
- Check mcp_twitter tools
- Document EXACTLY what each provides

**2. Analyze Content Generation Options** (15 min)

- social-media-mcp: create_post tool
- Any other MCPs with content generation?
- Compare capabilities vs what we need

**3. Redesign write-posts and write-scripts** (30 min)

- Use ACTUAL available tools
- Not hypothetical OpenAI calls
- Leverage what we have

**4. Test ONE Workflow End-to-End** (30 min)

- Verify our assumptions
- See what actually works
- Identify real gaps (not imagined ones)

---

## üí° HYPOTHESIS

**I think we might ALREADY have everything we need:**

**For Research:**

- ‚úÖ exa - Deep research
- ‚úÖ social-media-mcp - Trending topics, Brave search, research_topic
- ‚úÖ youtube-transcript - Video examples

**For Analysis:**

- ‚úÖ Apify - ALL platforms
- ‚úÖ youtube-transcript - Transcripts

**For Content Generation:**

- ‚úÖ social-media-mcp - create_post with AI (OpenAI/Anthropic)
- ‚ùì mcp_twitter - might have content tools
- ‚ùì youtube-uploader-mcp - might have script tools

**For Posting (not Jarvis but good to know):**

- ‚úÖ social-media-mcp - create_post
- ‚úÖ mcp_twitter - tweets
- ‚úÖ youtube-uploader-mcp - YouTube uploads
- ‚úÖ Custom modules - Twitter, LinkedIn

**We might be 95% there already!**

## üéØ ACTION PLAN (Corrected)

**Do NOT implement anything yet**

**Phase 1: Full Discovery** (30-45 min)

1. List tools from social-media-mcp
2. List tools from youtube-uploader-mcp
3. List tools from mcp_twitter
4. Check if social-media-mcp's create_post can generate full content
5. Check if any MCP has script generation

**Phase 2: Map to Workflows** (30 min)

1. Which MCP for which workflow step?
2. Can we use social-media-mcp for write-posts?
3. Can we use something for write-scripts?
4. Do we need OpenAI direct? Or is it already covered?

**Phase 3: Update Workflows** (1 hour)

1. Use ACTUAL tools we have
2. Not rushed assumptions
3. Proper implementation

**Phase 4: Test** (2 hours)

1. One workflow at a time
2. Validate assumptions
3. Fix real issues (not imagined ones)

---

**PAUSING all implementation until full discovery complete.**

**What do we ACTUALLY have?**
**Let me find out properly.**
