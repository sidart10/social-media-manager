## ðŸ§ª TEST SEQUENCE (Execute in Order)

### **TEST 1: Agent Activation - Jarvis** (5 min)

**Command:**
```bash
/jarvis
```

**Expected Behavior:**
1. Loads config from `bmad/agents/content-intelligence/config.yaml`
2. Loads `jarvis-sidecar/notion-helper.md`

**If Fails:** Check config.yaml paths, check notion-helper.md exists

---

### **TEST 2: Agent Activation - Zoe** (5 min)

**Command:**
```bash
/zoe
```

**Expected Behavior:**
1. Loads config from `bmad/agents/zoe/config.yaml`

- [ ] Unified menu shows (not separate image/video agents)
- [ ] Can see: *create-image, *create-carousel, *create-scene, *create-talking-head, etc.
- [ ] All 13 workflows visible

**If Fails:** Check zoe/ folder exists, check config.yaml, check workflows/ folder

---

### **TEST 3: Agent Activation - Zoro** (5 min)

**Command:**
```bash
/zoro
```

**Expected Behavior:**
1. Loads config from `bmad/agents/zoro/config.yaml`

3. Queries Notion for publish-ready content
4. Shows menu with 11 workflows

**Validation:**
- [ ] Agent activates without errors
- [ ] Menu shows *schedule-post as PRIMARY
- [ ] Can see backup workflows: *publish-tweet-now, *publish-linkedin-now, etc.

**If Fails:** Check zoro/ folder (renamed from social-posting-agent), check workflows/ folder structure

---

### **TEST 4: Skill Discovery - write-posts** (15 min)

**Command:**
```bash
/jarvis
*write-post

# When prompted:
Topic: "Testing the AI social media system"
Platform: LinkedIn
Reference: none
```

**Expected Behavior:**
1. Workflow loads voice profile from memories.md
2. Selects voice mode (probably Analyst for tech topic)
3. **Claude discovers post-writer skill** (description matches "LinkedIn posts")
4. Skill generates post using Justin Welsh PAIPS formula
5. **Claude discovers voice-matcher skill** (validates consistency)
6. Returns confidence score
7. **Claude discovers platform-formatter skill** (LinkedIn formatting)
8. Saves to: 03-drafts/linkedin/post-v1.md
9. Attempts Notion update (may succeed or gracefully fail if page not linked)

**Validation:**
- [ ] Post generated (any output is success - testing if workflow runs)
- [ ] Voice profile mentioned (if exists in memories.md)
- [ ] Platform formula applied (PAIPS structure visible)
- [ ] File saved to correct location
- [ ] No crashes or unhandled errors

**If Fails:** Likely skill discovery issue - check skill descriptions, check SKILL.md files exist

---

### **TEST 5: Image Generation - create-single-image** (15 min)

**Command:**
```bash
/zoe
*create-image

# When prompted:
Prompt: "Professional tech workspace with laptop"
Design: LinkedIn dark tech
Upload to Cloudinary: skip (unless Cloudinary configured)
```

**Expected Behavior:**
1. **Claude discovers create-image skill** (Emily JSON methodology)
2. **Claude discovers linkedin-design skill** (dark tech aesthetic)
3. Skill constructs JSON prompt with 10+ sections
4. **Claude discovers mcp-tool-selection skill** (chooses gpt-image-1 for LinkedIn)
5. Generates image via gpt-image-1 MCP
6. Runs 7-pillar quality evaluation
7. Saves to: 04-media/images/{filename}.png
8. (Cloudinary step skipped if not configured)
9. (Notion update attempted)

**Validation:**
- [ ] Image generated successfully
- [ ] Emily JSON methodology mentioned
- [ ] 7-pillar evaluation shown
- [ ] File saved to 04-media/images/
- [ ] Quality score displayed

**If Fails:** Check gpt-image-1 or nanobanana MCP configured, check create-image skill exists

---

### **TEST 6: Integration Check - Notion** (10 min)

**Already Validated:**
- âœ… Notion MCP connection works
- âœ… Query returned 14+ items
- âœ… Performance: 2 seconds

**Additional Test:**
Run generate-ideas and check if pages created in Notion (if you want full validation)

**Skip for now:** Can validate during Epic 7 comprehensive testing

---

### **TEST 7: Integration Check - Cloudinary** (10 min)

**Test if Cloudinary MCP accessible:**

```bash
# Try uploading a test image
# This would be part of create-single-image workflow (step 8.5)
```

**If Cloudinary not configured:**
- Workflows will skip upload
- Local files still saved
- System still functional (Cloudinary optional for now)

**If you want to test:** Need Cloudinary credentials in .env or Claude Code MCP settings

---

## ðŸ“Š MINIMAL VALIDATION (30 min - RECOMMENDED)

**Quick tests to validate system works:**
1. âœ… Test /jarvis activation (5 min)
2. âœ… Test /zoe activation (5 min)
3. âœ… Test /zoro activation (5 min)
4. âœ… Test write-posts generates content (15 min)

**Result:** Confidence the system is operational â†’ Can mark Epic 4-6 as "validated"

---

## ðŸŽ¯ FULL VALIDATION (2-3 hours)

**If you want comprehensive testing:**
1. All 3 agents (Test Suite 1)
2. All critical workflows (Test Suite 2)
3. Generate real content for your social media
4. Validate Notion updates work
5. Test Cloudinary if configured

**Result:** Epic 7 at 30-40% â†’ MVP at 70%+

---

## ðŸ’¡ WHAT TO EXPECT

**Likely Scenarios:**

**Best Case:** Everything works perfectly
- All agents activate
- All workflows run
- Skills discovered
- Notion updates
- Files saved correctly

**Most Likely:** Minor issues
- Some skills not discovered (description needs tweaking)
- Some Notion updates fail (graceful degradation working)
- Some MCP integrations not configured (expected - can configure later)
- Some workflow steps need adjustment

**Worst Case:** Integration issues
- MCP servers not accessible
- Skills not loading
- Workflows not finding files

**Recovery:** All issues fixable - we have comprehensive documentation of what should work!

---

## ðŸŽ¯ RECOMMENDATION

**Start with MINIMAL VALIDATION (30 min):**

1. Test each agent activates (15 min)
2. Test ONE workflow (write-posts) (15 min)

**If tests pass:**
- Mark Epics 4-6 as "functionally validated"
- Update MVP to 70%
- Document success

**If tests reveal issues:**
- Debug and fix (comprehensive docs help)
- Iterate until working
- Then mark complete

ðŸ§™ **SHALL THE BUILDER GUIDE YOU THROUGH THE TESTS?**

**Let's start with:**
1. **Test Jarvis** (`/jarvis` command)?
2. **Test all 3 agents** (systematic)?
3. **Jump to workflow test** (test write-posts)?
