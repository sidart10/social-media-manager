## üî• WHAT IT ACTUALLY HAS (Way More Than We Thought!)

### Research Engine Components

**1. Brave Search Client** (`src/research/brave/client.ts`)

- Web search (top 10 results)
- News search (recent articles)
- Discussion search (forums, Reddit, etc.)
- **Hashtag extraction** (auto-generates relevant hashtags)
- **Keyword extraction** (identifies key terms)
- **Fact extraction** (finds sentences with data/stats)

**2. Perplexity Client** (`src/research/perplexity/mcp-client.ts`)

- Deep research with AI
- Detailed topic exploration
- Fact gathering

**3. Research Aggregator** (`src/research/aggregator/index.ts`)

- Combines Brave + Perplexity
- Organizes results by type
- Tracks sources

## üéØ MCP Tool: research_topic

**What the tool does when you call it:**

```javascript
researchTopic(topic, {
  includeHashtags: true, // Extract relevant hashtags
  includeFacts: true, // Find key facts/stats
  includeTrends: true, // Get trending data
  includeNews: true, // Get latest news
});
```

**Returns:**

```javascript
{
  sources: [
    {name: "Brave Search", type: "search", timestamp: "..."},
    {name: "Perplexity", type: "ai-research", timestamp: "..."}
  ],

  hashtags: [
    "#AIAutomation",
    "#ProductivityTools",
    "#NoCode",
    "#WorkflowOptimization",
    "#AITools"
  ],

  facts: [
    "73% of developers automate less than 20% of their workflows",
    "AI automation market growing 28% year-over-year",
    "According to research, automation saves average 10 hours/week"
  ],

  news: [
    {
      title: "New AI Automation Platform Launches",
      url: "https://techcrunch.com/...",
      source: "TechCrunch",
      summary: "...",
      publishedAt: "2025-10-20"
    }
  ],

  trends: [
    {name: "#AITrends", volume: 15000, category: "general"},
    {name: "#AutomationNews", volume: 12000, category: "news"}
  ]
}
```

## üö® WHAT WE'RE MISSING IN CURRENT WORKFLOW

### Current research-topic workflow (line 36):

```xml
<action>Call social_media_mcp/research_topic</action>
```

**Problem:** We're calling it but NOT using all its capabilities!

**We should be using:**

```xml
<action>Call social_media_mcp/research_topic with ALL options:</action>
<action>Parameters:
  topic: {topic}
  includeHashtags: true    ‚Üê Get relevant hashtags
  includeFacts: true       ‚Üê Get key facts/stats
  includeTrends: true      ‚Üê Get trending data
  includeNews: true        ‚Üê Get latest news
</action>

<action>Extract from results:
  - hashtags[] ‚Üí Use for Idea Cards
  - facts[] ‚Üí Use as evidence
  - news[] ‚Üí Recent developments
  - trends[] ‚Üí Why this topic is hot
  - sources[] ‚Üí Track evidence
</action>
```

**This ONE tool gives us:**

- ‚úÖ Hashtags (for content)
- ‚úÖ Facts with sources (for evidence)
- ‚úÖ News articles (for timeliness)
- ‚úÖ Trending data (for "why now")
- ‚úÖ Brave Search results (web + news + discussions)
- ‚úÖ Perplexity research (AI-powered deep dive)

## üí° ULTRATHINK REALIZATION

**You're absolutely right - we're NOT fully leveraging social-media-mcp!**

### What we SHOULD do with Claude Skills:

**Create specialized Skills that ORCHESTRATE MCPs:**

### Skill: social-media-research

```yaml
---
name: social-media-research
description: Research topics using social-media-mcp comprehensive research engine (Brave Search + Perplexity). Automatically extracts hashtags, facts, trends, and news. Use when researching topics for social media content, when user asks about trending topics, hashtags, or current facts about a subject.

## üéØ PROPOSED ARCHITECTURE

### Research Skills (Each Specialized):

1. **social-media-research** Skill
   - Uses: social-media-mcp (Brave + Perplexity)
   - Gets: Hashtags, facts, trends, news
   - When: User wants social media focused research

2. **youtube-research** Skill
   - Uses: youtube-transcript + apify
   - Gets: Transcripts, structure patterns, quotes
   - When: User wants video examples

3. **profile-analysis** Skill
   - Uses: apify (all platform scrapers)
   - Gets: Profile data, post patterns, engagement
   - When: User provides profile URLs

4. **deep-web-research** Skill
   - Uses: exa
   - Gets: Comprehensive web research, company intel
   - When: User wants in-depth analysis

5. **research-synthesizer** Skill
   - Uses: All above Skills
   - Combines: All research sources
   - Creates: Unified research brief

**Claude autonomously picks which Skills based on the question!**

---

## üöÄ THIS IS THE RIGHT APPROACH

**Why your thinking is correct:**

‚úÖ **Modular** - Each Skill focuses on one MCP's strengths
‚úÖ **Autonomous** - Claude picks right Skill(s) for question
‚úÖ **Composable** - Skills combine for complex research
‚úÖ **MCP-Optimized** - Each Skill uses its MCP fully (not partially)
‚úÖ **Maintainable** - Update Skills independently

**Example:**
- Simple question: "What's trending?" ‚Üí Only social-media-research Skill
- Complex question: "Research AI tools + analyze competitors" ‚Üí Multiple Skills combine
- Medium question: "Get YouTube examples" ‚Üí Only youtube-research Skill

---

## üéØ NEXT STEPS

**Should I:**

1. **Create the 5 Research Skills** (1.5 hours)
   - social-media-research (leverage social-media-mcp FULLY)
   - youtube-research (transcripts + analysis)
   - profile-analysis (apify expertise)
   - deep-web-research (exa expertise)
   - research-synthesizer (combines all)

2. **Simplify research-topic workflow** (30 min)
   - Remove explicit MCP calls
   - Add natural language instructions
   - Let Skills orchestrate the MCPs

3. **Test autonomous Skill invocation** (30 min)
   - Ask questions that trigger different Skills
   - Verify Claude picks right ones
   - Validate research quality

**Total:** 2.5 hours to Skills-powered research system
