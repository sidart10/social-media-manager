# üéØ Claude Code Skills - THE PERFECT SOLUTION for Jarvis!

**Date:** 2025-10-26
**Discovery:** Claude Skills can REPLACE fictional script_generation_mcp!

---

## üí° WHAT ARE CLAUDE CODE SKILLS?

**Skills** = Self-contained capabilities that Claude automatically invokes when relevant

**Key Features:**

- ‚úÖ **Autonomous** - Claude decides when to use them (you don't explicitly call them)
- ‚úÖ **Simple** - Just a folder with `SKILL.md` file
- ‚úÖ **Token-efficient** - Only loaded when needed (~few dozen tokens)
- ‚úÖ **Discoverable** - Claude finds them based on description
- ‚úÖ **Shareable** - Personal (`~/.claude/skills/`) or Project (`.claude/skills/`)

**How It Works:**

```
You: "Research AI automation tools"
Claude: Sees your request ‚Üí Checks available Skills
       ‚Üí Finds "research-aggregator" Skill (matches description)
       ‚Üí Loads Skill instructions
       ‚Üí Executes research using Skill guidance
```

### Skill 3: voice-matcher

**Enhances:** write-posts and write-scripts

**What it does:**

- Loads voice profile from memories.md
- Adjusts vocabulary, sentence structure, tone
- Applies signature phrases
- Matches emoji usage

### Skill 4: platform-formatter

**Enhances:** write-posts and write-scripts

**What it does:**

# Research Aggregator Skill

## Purpose
Aggregate research findings from multiple sources and organize into structured markdown with evidence tracking.

## Instructions

When research is gathered from multiple sources:

1. **Create Research Notes File**
   - Location: jarvis-sidecar/sessions/research-notes-{topic}-{date}.md
   - Structure:
     ## Session Metadata
     Topic: {topic}
     Date: {date}
     Sources: {source_count}

     ## Findings

2. **Organize by Category**
   - Create 5 sections:
     ### 1. Trends & Timing
     ### 2. Data & Statistics
     ### 3. Examples & Case Studies
     ### 4. Quotes & Expert Opinions
     ### 5. Gaps & Opportunities

3. **For Each Finding:**
   - Content: The finding itself
   - Source: [Title](URL)
   - Timestamp: If video (e.g., 2:34)
   - Confidence: high|medium|low

4. **Synthesize Section**
   - Executive summary (3-5 key takeaways)
   - Most compelling findings
   - Evidence strength assessment

## Example Output

### 1. Trends & Timing

**Finding:** AI automation tools trending +240% on LinkedIn
**Source:** [LinkedIn Trends](url)
**Confidence:** High

**Finding:** "No-code automation" search volume up 180% YoY
**Source:** [Google Trends](url)
**Confidence:** High

### 2. Data & Statistics

**Finding:** 73% of developers automate < 20% of their workflows
**Source:** [DevSurvey 2025](url)
**Confidence:** Medium (survey sample: 1,200)

[etc...]

## When to Use This Skill

- User runs /research-topic workflow
- Gathering data from exa, social-media-mcp, youtube-transcript
- Need to organize findings into categories
- Creating research briefs or reports
```

## üîß HOW TO IMPLEMENT FOR JARVIS

### Step 1: Create Skills Directory

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/jarvis/
```

### Step 2: Create Skills for Jarvis

**Skills we need:**

1. **research-aggregator** - Note-taking & synthesis
2. **content-generator** - Platform-specific content generation
3. **voice-matcher** - Voice profile application
4. **platform-formatter** - Platform formatting & validation
5. **evidence-tracker** - Source link & timestamp tracking

### Step 3: Update Workflows

**Instead of:**

```xml
<action>Tool: script_generation_mcp/add_note</action>
<action>Parameters: name="trends", content={data}</action>
```

**Use:**

```xml
<action>Invoke research-aggregator Skill</action>
<action>Claude will automatically:
  - Create structured markdown file
  - Organize findings by category
  - Track sources
  - Build synthesis
</action>
```

**How:**

- Remove explicit MCP tool calls
- Let Claude's Skill system handle it
- Skill activates automatically based on context

## üé® SKILLS VS MCP COMPARISON

| Aspect             | MCP Servers                           | Claude Skills                    |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Invocation**     | Explicit tool calls                   | Automatic (Claude decides)       |
| **Dependency**     | External servers (connection issues)  | Built-in (always available)      |
| **Setup**          | npm install, config, debug connection | Just create SKILL.md file        |
| **Reliability**    | Can fail to connect                   | Always works                     |
| **Maintenance**    | Update packages, debug issues         | Update markdown file             |
| **Token Usage**    | Variable                              | Efficient (few dozen tokens)     |
| **Distribution**   | npm packages, repos                   | Git (project) or personal folder |
| **Learning Curve** | Complex (MCP protocol)                | Simple (markdown instructions)   |

## üí° THE BRILLIANT INSIGHT

**What you're suggesting:**

Instead of fighting with fictional MCPs, **use Claude Code Skills** which are:

- ‚úÖ Native to Claude Code
- ‚úÖ Always available (no connection issues)
- ‚úÖ Autonomous (Claude knows when to use them)
- ‚úÖ Simple to create (just markdown)
- ‚úÖ Easy to update (edit SKILL.md)
- ‚úÖ Shareable (git commit)

**For Jarvis workflows:**

- Keep MCPs for external data (apify, exa, social-media-mcp, youtube-transcript)
- Use Skills for internal logic (note-taking, synthesis, formatting, voice-matching)

**This is the HYBRID approach:**

- MCPs = Data sources (platforms, research APIs)
- Skills = Processing logic (organization, generation, formatting)

---

## üöÄ IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

### Phase 1: Create Essential Skills (1 hour)

**Skill 1: research-aggregator**

```
~/.claude/skills/jarvis/research-aggregator/SKILL.md
```

- Handles note-taking from all research sources
- Organizes into 5 categories
- Tracks evidence
- Creates synthesis

**Skill 2: content-generator**

```
~/.claude/skills/jarvis/content-generator/SKILL.md
```

- Generates platform-specific content
- Uses templates and patterns
- Injects evidence
- Multiple formats (posts, scripts, threads)

**Skill 3: voice-matcher**

```
~/.claude/skills/jarvis/voice-matcher/SKILL.md
```

- Loads voice profile from memories.md
- Applies vocabulary, tone, rhythm
- Injects signature phrases
- Matches emoji usage

---

### Phase 2: Update Workflows (30 min)

**Remove:**

- All script_generation_mcp/add_note calls
- All script_generation_mcp/summarize_notes calls
- All script_generation_mcp/script_generate calls

**Replace with:**

- Natural language instructions
- Claude autonomously invokes Skills
- Cleaner, simpler workflow logic

**Example Before:**

```xml
<action>Tool: script_generation_mcp/add_note</action>
<action>Parameters: name="trends", content={data}</action>
```

**Example After:**

```xml
<action>Store trend findings in research notes</action>
<!-- Claude sees "store...research notes" ‚Üí invokes research-aggregator Skill ‚Üí
executes note storage -->
```

---

### Phase 3: Test (30 min)

- Test research-topic with Skills
- Verify Claude invokes Skills automatically
- Validate output quality
- Refine Skill descriptions if needed

---

## üìã EXAMPLE: research-aggregator SKILL.md

```yaml
---
name: research-aggregator
description: Aggregate and organize research findings from multiple sources (exa, social-media-mcp, youtube transcripts) into structured markdown with 5 categories (trends, data, examples, quotes, gaps). Track all evidence with source URLs and timestamps. Use when conducting research, gathering data, or organizing findings for Jarvis research-topic or generate-ideas workflows.

**Output:** Structured markdown file with:
- 15-30 organized findings
- All sources cited
- Evidence tracked
- Synthesis section
- Ready for content angle generation

## Quality Standards

- Every finding MUST have source
- Video findings MUST have timestamps
- Confidence scores MUST be justified
