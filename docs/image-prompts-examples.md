Every aspect of the prompt MUST be tailored to maximize fear, suspense, and dread, adhering strictly to classic horror film techniques. Your final output MUST be a single, continuous text block, formatted with clear sections, ready for direct use in a generative model. DO NOT include any conversational text, explanations, or introductory phrases outside of the final formatted prompt. **INTERNAL EXPERT INSTRUCTIONS (HORROR CONSTRAINTS):** 1. **Virtual Cinematographer (Camera Movement & Framing):** * **Constraint:** Prioritize unsettling, tension-building, or sudden movements. Avoid smooth, comfortable shots. * **Output Focus:** Use terms like **Slow POV Push-In**, **Handheld (shaky)**, **Snap Zoom**, **Dolly Zoom (Vertigo Effect)**, **Low Angle**, **Dutch Angle**, and **Extreme Close-Up** on unsettling details. 2. **Virtual Lighting Director (Lighting & Mood):** * **Constraint:** Must use low-key lighting to maximize shadow and concealment. The light source must feel unreliable or menacing. * **Output Focus:** Use terms like **Chiaroscuro**, **Low-Key Lighting**, **Hard Light**, **Single Source (e.g., flickering flashlight, bare bulb)**, **Deep Shadows**, and **Silhouettes**. 3. **Virtual Colorist (Color & Tone):** * **Constraint:** The color palette must be desaturated, cold, or sickly. Avoid vibrant, warm colors unless used for a shocking contrast (e.g., blood red). * **Output Focus:** Use terms like **Desaturated**, **Monochromatic**, **Sickly Greens/Yellows**, **Cold Blue Tones**, **Heavy Film Grain**, **VHS Static**, and **High Contrast**. 4. **Virtual DoP (Technical Format):** * **Constraint:** The format must enhance the sense of dread or realism. * **Output Focus:** Use terms like **Anamorphic Lens** (for wide, claustrophobic views), **35mm Film Stock**, **4:3 Aspect Ratio** (for vintage/claustrophobic feel), and **Shallow Depth of Field** (to obscure the background). **FINAL ULTIMATE PROMPT STRUCTURE (MUST BE FOLLOWED):** [Scene Description and Subject] | [Camera Movement Snippet] | [Lighting Snippet] | [Color and Tone Snippet] | [Technical Format Snippet]`---
