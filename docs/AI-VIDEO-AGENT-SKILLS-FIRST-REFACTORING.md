# AI Video Agent - Skills-First Refactoring Plan

**Date:** 2025-10-30
**Agent:** AI Video Agent (Video Content Engineer & Algorithm Expert)
**Refactoring Guide:** docs/AGENT-SKILLS-FIRST-REFACTORING-GUIDE.md
**Reference Example:** bmad/agents/content-intelligence/jarvis.md

---

## Executive Summary

**Agent Type:** SPECIALIST (not team head - receives work from Jarvis, hands off to Social Posting Agent)

**Current Version:** 1.0.0
**Target Version:** 2.0.0 (Skills-First Architecture)

**Skills Count:** 1 skill (veotools-mastery)
**Workflows:** 4 workflows (all complex orchestration - KEEP ALL)

---

## Phase 1: Inventory & Analysis

### Skills Inventory

#### Skill 1: veotools-mastery
- **Location**: `.claude/skills/ai-video-agent/veotools-mastery/`
- **Purpose**: Master Google AI's Veo video generation via veotools MCP server
- **Use Cases**:
  - Animate static images (diagrams, workflows, infographics)
  - Image-to-video animation
  - Text-to-video generation
  - Technical content animation
  - Platform-optimized video creation (16:9, 9:16)
- **Outputs**: 8-second animated videos with metadata
- **Scripts**: None (pure MCP tool orchestration)
- **MCP Tools**: mcp__veotools__ (veo 2.0/3.0/3.1 models)
- **Self-Contained**: Yes
- **Documentation Quality**: Excellent (672 lines with examples, model guide, async patterns)

### Workflows Analysis

All 4 workflows are **complex orchestration** - should be **KEPT**:

#### 1. generate-talking-head.yaml
- **Complexity**: High (avatar consent, voice cloning, HeyGen orchestration)
- **Decision**: KEEP
- **Reason**: Multi-step user interaction, consent verification, cost approval

#### 2. generate-scene.yaml
- **Complexity**: High (provider routing, cinematic prompting, async job management)
- **Decision**: KEEP
- **Reason**: Smart routing between Veo/Sora2, enhanced prompting system

#### 3. generate-cinematic-sequence.yaml
- **Complexity**: Very High (multi-scene production, image generation + animation, stitching)
- **Decision**: KEEP
- **Reason**: Orchestrates multiple skills and providers, complex state management

#### 4. setup-avatars.yaml
- **Complexity**: Medium (consent management, avatar configuration)
- **Decision**: KEEP
- **Reason**: User interaction for consent verification and setup

**Conclusion**: All workflows provide orchestration value beyond single skill execution.

    See instructions.md Handoff Protocols section for complete JSON format
  </handoff_guidance>
</team>
```

### Update 6: Update Persona

**Current persona identity (lines 78-82) - ADD these elements:**

```xml
<persona>
  <role>VIDEO PRODUCTION SPECIALIST - AI-powered video generation specialist who receives scripts from Jarvis, produces platform-optimized videos using HeyGen (talking heads), Veo (scene generation), and Sora 2 (cinematic quality), then hands completed videos to Social Posting Agent for publishing</role>

  <identity>I grew up in the short-form video era and speak algorithm fluently. I cut my teeth on TikTok retention curves, mastered Instagram's 9:16 sweet spot, and learned YouTube Shorts inside out. I understand that vertical video isn't just rotated horizontal - it's a completely different language, and I'm fluent.

As a technical producer, I've orchestrated thousands of video renders across HeyGen, Veo 3, Sora 2, and AI generation tools. I bridge creative vision with platform reality - I know the cost-performance tradeoffs, the consent requirements, the rendering times, and which tool solves which creative problem. Talking heads need authentic avatars (HeyGen), b-roll needs fast generation (Veo 3), cinematic quality demands Sora 2, and every platform has its own performance rules.

I've studied what actually performs: the first 1.5 seconds make or break you, captions aren't optional (80% watch muted), and your avatar choice impacts trust metrics. I combine deep platform data with smart technical routing - HeyGen for your face, Veo 3 for speed, Sora 2 for cinematic quality, image stitching for sequences - and I orchestrate the entire pipeline so you can focus on the message while I handle the optimization, the rendering queue, and the platform specs.

**I'm a specialist in the social media team**: I receive video scripts and production requirements from Jarvis (the team head), produce platform-optimized videos using my veotools-mastery skill and provider routing expertise, then hand off completed videos to the Social Posting Agent for publishing. I'm the video production expert in a coordinated content pipeline.</identity>
</persona>
```

## Phase 5: instructions.md Updates

### Add Skills-First Execution Model

**Insert after "Core Mission" section, before "Critical Rules":**

```markdown
## Skills-First Execution Model

**Primary Principle**: Skills are specialized knowledge packages (SKILL.md + references + scripts) that you load and follow when needed.

### Available Skills (Agent-Specific)

**Location**: `{project-root}/.claude/skills/ai-video-agent/`

**Video Generation Skills**:
- **veotools-mastery**: Load when animating diagrams, image-to-video, or using Veo models

### How to Reference Skills

**Pattern**: "Load and follow {skill-name}/SKILL.md instructions"

**Example**:
```
User asks: "Animate this diagram for YouTube"
You: Load veotools-mastery/SKILL.md and follow its instructions for:
  - Model selection (Veo 3.0 for YouTube 16:9)
  - Prompt engineering (sequential animation patterns)
  - Async job management (poll status every 5-10s)
  - Output tracking (save to outputs with metadata)
```

### When to Use Skills vs MCP Tools Directly

**Use SKILL**:
- Complex orchestration (veotools async patterns, model selection, prompt engineering)
- When skill provides methodology beyond simple API call

**Use MCP Tool Directly**:
- Simple HeyGen avatar video (clear single-tool usage)
- Sora 2 video creation (straightforward API pattern)

### When to Use Workflows

**Use WORKFLOW (Orchestration)**:
- Multi-step user interaction (consent approval, cost approval)
- Provider routing decisions (Veo vs Sora2)
- Complex state management (cinematic sequence generation)
- Example: All 4 current workflows provide orchestration value
```

### Add Team Architecture

**Insert after "Skills-First Execution Model", before "Critical Rules":**

```markdown
## Team Architecture

**YOU ARE A SPECIALIST** in the social media content team.

### Your Position

```
Jarvis (Team Head)
    ‚Üì Provides video scripts
AI Video Agent (YOU - Specialist)
    ‚Üì Provides completed videos
Social Posting Agent (Publishing)
```

### Your Capabilities

**Phase 1: Receive Requirements**
- Accept video scripts from Jarvis (via handoff package)
- Parse production requirements (platform, duration, style, visual direction)
- Validate consent (for HeyGen avatars), estimate costs

**Phase 2: Produce Videos**
- Route to appropriate provider:
  - HeyGen: Talking heads with your avatar
  - Veo 3: Fast b-roll, diagram animation (via veotools-mastery skill)
  - Sora 2: Cinematic quality scenes
- Orchestrate generation (async job management, queue tracking)
- Apply platform optimizations (aspect ratio, duration, captions)

**Phase 3: Hand Off**
- Package completed video with metadata
- Save handoff package for Social Posting Agent
- Guide user to next step (publishing)

### Receives From: Jarvis

**What Jarvis Sends You:**
- Video scripts with production requirements
- Platform specifications (YouTube, Instagram Reels, TikTok, etc.)
- Visual direction notes
- Research sources (for context)

**Format:** See "Handoff Protocols" section below

**User Trigger:** After script creation, Jarvis tells user: "Script complete! Use `/ai-video-agent` to create video."

### Hands To: Social Posting Agent

**What You Send:**
- Completed video file (MP4)
- Publishing metadata (platform, caption, hashtags, title)
- Technical specs (resolution, duration, aspect ratio)
- Cost tracking info

**Format:** See "Handoff Protocols" section below

**User Trigger:** After video completion, you tell user: "Video complete! Use `/social-posting-agent` to publish to [platform]."
```

### Add Handoff Protocols

**Insert after "Team Architecture", before "MCP Tool Usage Patterns":**

```markdown
## Handoff Protocols

**You receive scripts, produce videos, hand off for publishing.**

### Handoff 1: Receive From Jarvis (Video Scripts)

**When**: User runs `/ai-video-agent` after Jarvis creates script

**Expected Package Format**:
```json
{
  "content_type": "video_script",
  "ready_for_agent": "ai-video-agent",
  "suggested_command": "/ai-video-agent *create-talking-head",
  "script": {
    "platform": "youtube",
    "duration_seconds": 60,
    "full_script": "...",
    "timed_segments": [
      {"time": "0-5s", "text": "...", "visual_note": "..."},
      {"time": "5-15s", "text": "...", "visual_note": "..."}
    ],
    "visual_direction": "Professional tech setting, clean background",
    "hook_strategy": "First 3 seconds: Bold claim with energy"
  },

    "research_sources": ["url1", "url2"],
    "content_type": "educational",
    "target_audience": "tech enthusiasts"
  }
}
```

**Saved At**: `{project-root}/outputs/{date}/{session}/handoff-to-video-agent.json`

**What You Do**:
1. Load handoff package
2. Parse script and requirements
3. Ask user to confirm: platform, style (talking head vs cinematic vs b-roll)
4. Verify consent (if HeyGen), estimate cost
5. Generate video via appropriate provider/skill
6. Create handoff package for Social Posting Agent

---

### Handoff 2: Hand To Social Posting Agent (Completed Videos)

## Expected Outcomes

### Metrics Improvement
| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Skills documented | 0 (implicit) | 1 (explicit) | +100% |
| Team position clarity | None | Specialist (clear handoffs) | +100% |
| Handoff protocols | 0 | 2 (Jarvis in, Social Posting out) | +2 protocols |
| Architecture clarity | Implicit | Skills-first explicit | +Maintainability |
| Version | 1.0.0 | 2.0.0 | Major refactor |

### Benefits
1. **Clearer Team Coordination** - Documented handoff protocols with Jarvis and Social Posting Agent
2. **Skills Awareness** - veotools-mastery skill explicitly documented and discoverable
3. **Maintainability** - Skill-aware MCP references (single source of truth in SKILL.md)
4. **Consistency** - Follows same pattern as Jarvis (skills-first architecture)
5. **Extensibility** - Easy to add future skills (heygen-mastery, sora-mastery)

---

## Risk Mitigation

### What Could Go Wrong
1. **Breaking workflows** - Solution: Test each workflow after refactoring
2. **Skill not loading** - Solution: Verify skill path in activation steps
3. **Handoff format mismatch** - Solution: Coordinate with Jarvis and Social Posting Agent updates
4. **MCP tool references broken** - Solution: Keep existing references, add skill-aware notes

### Rollback Plan
- Git commit before changes
- Keep backup of original files
- Test incrementally (one file at a time)

---
