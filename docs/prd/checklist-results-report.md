## Top Issues by Priority

**BLOCKERS:** None - All critical requirements documented

**HIGH Priority:**

1. **Epic 5 (Notion Integration) timeline risk**
   - Issue: Notion integration has no current implementation (20% complete), requires greenfield development
   - Impact: Could extend MVP timeline from 8-13 days to 10-15 days
   - Recommendation: Prioritize Epic 5 early (after Epic 1 documentation), or consider phasing (basic status updates in MVP, full relational intelligence in Phase 2)

2. **write-posts and write-scripts workflows DO NOT EXIST (verified)**
   - Issue: Filesystem check confirms these workflow folders do not exist in jarvis-sidecar/workflows/
   - Impact: Epic 2 Stories 2.2 and 2.3 are NEW DEVELOPMENT (not migration), adds 1-2 days to Epic 2 timeline
   - Current state: post-writer and video-script-writer SKILLS exist (expertise available), but WORKFLOWS need creation (process orchestration missing)
   - Recommendation: Create these workflows following Jarvis standardized pattern (external instructions.md, YAML config, template.md)

**MEDIUM Priority:**

3. **Tool performance tracking system doesn't exist yet**
   - Issue: Story 7.2 describes tool-performance.json logging, but this is new development
   - Impact: Tool optimization (Epic 7) depends on this, adds development effort
   - Recommendation: Simplify for MVPâ€”manual cost tracking in agent memories.md, automated tracking in Phase 2

4. **Handoff package JSON schemas not formally defined**
   - Issue: FR21-22 require validated JSON schemas, but no schema files exist
   - Impact: Agent coordination may be fragile without validation
   - Recommendation: Define minimal schema for MVP (source_agent, target_agent, content_type, file_paths), expand in Phase 2

**LOW Priority:**

5. **Postiz integration details light**
   - Issue: Story 4.4 describes schedule-via-postiz but workflow doesn't exist yet
   - Impact: Minorâ€”can use manual Postiz dashboard for MVP
   - Recommendation: Add to Phase 2 if not critical for MVP

---

## MVP Scope Assessment

**Features That Might Be Cut for True MVP:**

1. **Talking head videos (Story 3.6)** - HeyGen expensive ($0.20-0.50/min), niche use case
   - Recommendation: Defer to Phase 2 unless critical for your content strategy

2. **Carousel generation (Story 3.2)** - Time-intensive (3-6 min for 6-10 slides), higher cost ($0.40-0.80)
   - Recommendation: Keep if LinkedIn carousels are core strategy, otherwise defer

3. **Postiz scheduling (Story 4.4)** - Can manually schedule via Postiz dashboard
   - Recommendation: Defer to Phase 2, focus on direct API publishing for MVP

4. **Tool performance tracking (Story 7.2)** - Nice to have, but manual tracking works for MVP
   - Recommendation: Defer automated tracking, track costs manually in memories.md

**Missing Features That Are Essential:** None - All core capabilities documented

**Complexity Concerns:**

- **Epic 5 (Notion Integration)** is most complexâ€”requires Notion MCP mastery, schema understanding, relational data management
- **Epic 7 (Workflow Standardization)** is tedious but low-riskâ€”migrating 10+ Zoro workflows from embedded to external format

**Timeline Realism:**

- Original estimate: 8-13 days (overly optimistic)
- With verified scope: 14-19 days sequential
- **With strategic sequencing: 11-15 days** (parallelization optimized)

**Optimized Breakdown:**
  - **Phase 1:** Epic 1 (System Foundation) - 2-3 days
    - Stories 7.3-7.6: ARCHITECTURE.md + tool-registry + workflow-registry + output management
  - **Phase 2:** Epic 2 (Notion Integration) - 3-5 days âš¡ **GREENFIELD DE-RISKED EARLY**
    - Provides coordination layer enabling Phase 3 parallelization
  - **Phase 3: PARALLELIZABLE** (Days 9-15, longest epic determines phase duration)
    - Epic 3 (Content Intelligence): 1-2 days ðŸ”„
    - Epic 4 (Voice Content): 2-3 days ðŸ”„ **NEW workflows**
    - Epic 5 (Visual Production): 2-3 days ðŸ”„
    - Epic 6 (Publishing): 2-3 days ðŸ”„ **NEW Postiz workflow**
    - **Max parallel duration:** 3 days (longest epic), not 9 days sequential!
  - **Phase 4:** Epic 7 (Pipeline Testing) - 1-2 days
  - **Phase 5:** Epic 8 (Workflow Standardization) - 1-2 days

**Critical Path:** 3 + 5 + 3 + 2 + 2 = **15 days maximum** (if no parallelization)
**Optimized Path:** 3 + 5 + 3 (parallel) + 2 + 2 = **15 days** (parallelization doesn't reduce critical path but reduces risk)
**Best Case:** 3 + 3 (if Notion faster) + 3 + 1 + 1 = **11 days**

## Technical Readiness

**Clarity of Technical Constraints:**
âœ… **Excellent** - Claude Code platform, 20+ MCP integrations, custom Node.js API clients all documented. No ambiguity.

**Identified Technical Risks:**

1. **Notion MCP learning curve** - Never used Notion MCP in workflows before, may have unexpected complexities
2. **Workflow format migration** - Zoro's embedded JavaScript may have dependencies that break during migration
3. **Handoff package versioning** - If schema changes, how to handle backward compatibility?
4. **Apify actor reliability** - Scrapers may break as platforms update anti-bot measures (Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram)
5. **Voice profile drift** - As Claude models update, voice matching quality may degrade

**Areas Needing Architect Investigation:**

1. **Notion page creation strategy** - Should agents create new pages or only update existing? What about bulk operations?
2. **Error recovery patterns** - How to handle partial failures in multi-step workflows? (e.g., research succeeds, write-post failsâ€”how to resume?)
3. **Handoff package schema design** - JSON structure needs formal definition before implementation
4. **Tool abstraction boundaries** - Where exactly does skill end and workflow begin? Need clear guidelines.

## Recommendations

**To Address High Priority Issues:**

1. **Verify write-posts and write-scripts workflow files exist**
   - Action: Check bmad/agents/content-intelligence/jarvis-sidecar/workflows/ for write-posts/ and write-scripts/ folders
   - If missing: Flag as new development work (adds 1-2 days to Epic 2)
   - Owner: PM/Developer
   - Timeline: Before Epic 2 implementation starts

2. **Simplify Epic 5 for MVP** (if timeline is concern)
   - Action: Phase Notion integration into 2 releases:
     - MVP: Basic status updates only (Jarvis updates Status field, Zoro reads Status field)
     - Phase 2: Full relational intelligence (Keywords, Channels, Tasks, Analytics)
   - Rationale: Reduces MVP timeline risk (3-5 days â†’ 1-2 days for basic status)
   - Trade-off: Less collaborative workflow in MVP, but still functional

3. **Define minimal handoff JSON schema early**
   - Action: Create .bmad-core/schemas/handoff-package-v1.json during Epic 1
   - Minimal schema provided above
   - Timeline: Day 1-2 of Epic 1

4. **Add system architecture diagram**
   - Action: Create mermaid diagram showing User â†’ Agents (3) â†’ Workflows (20+) â†’ Skills (24+) â†’ Tools (MCPs) â†’ Platforms
   - Include Notion as collaborative layer
   - Timeline: During Epic 1 documentation

5. **Document tool registry for evolution**
   - Action: Create .bmad-core/data/tool-registry.yaml
   - Timeline: During Epic 7

## Final Decision

âœ… **READY FOR ARCHITECT** - The PRD and epics are comprehensive, properly structured, and ready for architectural design and implementation.

**Strengths:**
- Exceptional technical detail from actual workflow investigation (verified via filesystem checks)
- Complete agentâ†’workflowâ†’skillâ†’tool hierarchy with specific Apify actors, models, costs
- **Model-invoked skill discovery model properly documented** (workflows create context, Claude discovers skillsâ€”not explicit invocation)
- **Comprehensive terminology clarification** distinguishing our custom system from Claude Code native concepts
- Mermaid diagrams showing real implementation flows
- Cost/time estimates based on actual usage data (revised to 12-17 days with new scope)
- Clear extensibility vision with modular, organically-evolving architecture
- Both skills AND workflows emphasized as critical architectural components with proper distinction
- **Tool evolution process fully specified** (Story 7.4: tool-registry.yaml with monthly review cycle)
- **Workflow registry defined** (Story 7.5: machine-readable workflow inventory with dependencies)
- **Notion status transition rules established** (Story 5.2: forward-only transitions, validation logging, concurrent coordination)

**Verified Gaps Acknowledged:**
- write-posts and write-scripts workflows confirmed non-existent (need creation in Epic 2)
- Epic 5 (Notion) greenfield scope validated
- Timeline revised 8-13 â†’ 12-17 days reflecting verified scope

**Recommended Next Step:** Proceed to Epic 1 (Documentation + Registries) to establish foundation, then Epic 2 (create missing workflows) before Epic 5 (Notion integration).
