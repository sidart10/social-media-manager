- ✅ Cost models specified
- ✅ Evolution strategy defined

**Result:** ✅ **Complete tool inventory with optimization process**

---

### **Test 5: Output Structure** ✅ **PASS**

**Validated:**
- ✅ outputs/templates/project-structure/ exists (6 stages, 24 directories)
- ✅ Platform subfolders in 03-drafts/ and 05-published/
- ✅ metadata-template.json (platform-specific schema)

## 🎯 REMAINING VALIDATION (Epic 7 Full Testing)

**Needs Live Testing:**

**Functional Tests (2-3 days):**
1. ⏳ Execute research-topic workflow (test deep-web-research skill triggers)
2. ⏳ Execute write-posts workflow (test post-writer skill triggers)
3. ⏳ Execute create-single-image workflow (test Cloudinary upload)
4. ⏳ Execute schedule-post workflow (test Postiz scheduling)
5. ⏳ Full pipeline end-to-end (all steps)

**Integration Tests:**
6. ⏳ Notion status updates (verify transitions work)
7. ⏳ Cloudinary public URLs (verify upload works)
8. ⏳ Postiz multi-platform (verify scheduling works)
9. ⏳ Skill discovery (verify Claude finds skills correctly)

**Performance Tests:**
10. ⏳ Cost benchmarks (track actual costs)
11. ⏳ Time benchmarks (measure durations)
12. ⏳ Quality benchmarks (voice scores, image scores)
