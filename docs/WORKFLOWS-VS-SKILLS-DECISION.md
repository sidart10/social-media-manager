# Should We Deprecate Workflows? - Architectural Analysis

**Date:** 2025-10-28
**Question:** Should we move everything to skills and deprecate workflows?
**Investigator:** BMad Master
**Sources:** Anthropic official docs, engineering blog, cookbooks

---

## TL;DR Recommendation

**NO - Don't deprecate workflows!**

**Why:** Skills and workflows serve DIFFERENT purposes:
- **Skills** = Expert knowledge (WHAT/HOW)
- **Workflows** = Process orchestration (WHEN/WHERE/STATE)

**Better approach:** Make workflows THINNER, move more knowledge INTO skills

---

## What Anthropic Says About Skills

### From Engineering Blog

> "Building a skill for an agent is like putting together an **onboarding guide for a new hire**."

> "Instead of building fragmented, custom-designed agents for each use case, anyone can now specialize their agents with **composable capabilities** by capturing and sharing their **procedural knowledge**."

**Key words:**
- Onboarding guide
- Procedural knowledge
- Composable capabilities
- Expertise packages

**NOT mentioned:**
- State management
- Multi-step orchestration
- User interaction flows
- Conditional logic trees

---

### From Official Docs

> "Agent Skills package **expertise** into discoverable capabilities."

> "Skills are organized packages of **instructions, executable code, and resources**."

**Skills are for KNOWLEDGE, not ORCHESTRATION!**

---

## What Skills CAN Do

### ✅ Provide Expert Knowledge

**From cookbooks:**
- Financial analysis methodologies
- Brand guideline application
- Document creation instructions
- Data processing techniques

**Example:** post-writer skill
- Contains Justin Welsh formulas
- Contains Greg Isenberg patterns
- Contains viral engagement data
- Provides proven methodologies

---

### ✅ Include Executable Code

**From engineering blog:**
> "Skills can also include code for Claude to execute as tools at its discretion. Large language models excel at many tasks, but certain operations are better suited for traditional code execution."

**Example:** PDF skill
- Includes Python script to extract form fields
- Deterministic, reliable, repeatable
- Doesn't load PDF into context

**Use case:** When code is better than token generation (sorting, calculations, file processing)

---

### ✅ Progressive Disclosure

**Three levels:**
1. Metadata (name, description) - Loaded at session start
2. SKILL.md body - Loaded when relevant
3. Additional files (forms.md, reference.md) - Loaded on-demand

**From docs:**
> "Agents with a filesystem and code execution tools don't need to read the entirety of a skill into their context window when working on a particular task. This means that the amount of context that can be bundled into a skill is effectively unbounded."

**Benefit:** Massive skills possible, only load what's needed

---

### ✅ Compose with Other Skills

**From docs:**
> "Compose multiple Skills for complex tasks"

**Example:** Financial reporting workflow could use:
- `xlsx` skill (create spreadsheet)
- `pptx` skill (create presentation)
- `pdf` skill (create report)

**All automatically loaded and coordinated!**

---

## What Skills CANNOT (or Shouldn't) Do

### ❌ Complex State Management

**Skills don't maintain state across steps:**
- No "load voice profile, then use it in Step 5"
- No "store idea card, reference it later"
- No "track which step we're on"

**Why:** Skills are stateless knowledge packages

---

### ❌ User Interaction Mid-Flow

**Skills don't handle:**
- Asking user questions
- Getting confirmations
- Branching based on user choices
- Multi-turn conversations within task

**Example workflow interaction:**
```xml
<ask>Voice profile not found. Options:
  1. Run /learn-voice first
  2. Continue without voice
  3. Cancel
Select: [1/2/3]
</ask>

<check if="option 1">
  <action>Pause workflow</action>
  <action>Invoke learn-voice workflow</action>
  <action>Wait for completion</action>
  <action>Resume with voice loaded</action>
</check>
```

**Skills can't do this!**

---

### ❌ Multi-Step Orchestration

**Skills don't orchestrate sequences:**
- Load A → Process B → Save C → Call workflow D
- Step 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 with dependencies
- "Do X, then based on result do Y or Z"

**Example workflow orchestration:**
```xml
Step 0: Load voice profile
Step 1: Load idea card
Step 2: Generate content (use skill here!)
Step 3: Review with user
Step 4: Format for platform
Step 5: Generate variants
Step 6: Create handoff JSON
Step 7: Save to outputs/ with timestamp
```

**Skills can't orchestrate this flow!**

---

### ❌ File I/O to Specific Locations

**Skills don't manage:**
- Save to outputs/ with specific naming convention
- Create handoff JSONs in specific directories
- Organize outputs by date/platform/type
- Template file population

**Example workflow file management:**
```
Save to: bmad/agents/content-intelligence/jarvis-sidecar/outputs/linkedin-post-{topic}-{date}.md
Create handoff: bmad/agents/content-intelligence/jarvis-sidecar/outputs/linkedin-post-{topic}-{date}.json
```

**Skills can't manage file organization!**

---

### ❌ Platform-Specific Conditional Logic

**Skills don't handle complex branching:**

```xml
<check if="target_platform == 'linkedin'">
  <action>Apply LinkedIn formatting</action>
  <action>Validate with linkedin_api_client</action>
  <action>Create LinkedIn-specific handoff</action>
</check>

<check if="target_platform == 'twitter'">
  <ask>Format preference:
    1. Long-form (25K chars)
    2. Thread (multiple tweets)
    3. Generate both
  </ask>

  <check if="long-form selected">
    <action>Generate single long-form post</action>
  </check>

  <check if="thread selected">
    <action>Generate thread array</action>
    <action>Validate each tweet</action>
  </check>
</check>
```

**Skills provide knowledge, not decision trees!**

---

## What Our Workflows Currently Do

### Example: write-posts Workflow

**Orchestration (can't move to skill):**
- ✅ Step 0: Load voice profile from memories.md
- ✅ Step 1: Load idea card from previous workflow
- ❌ Step 2: Generate content ← SKILL DOES THIS!
- ✅ Step 3: Ask user for review/adjustments
- ✅ Step 4: Platform-specific formatting (LinkedIn vs Twitter branching)
- ✅ Step 5: Generate hook variants
- ✅ Step 6: Create handoff JSON for social-posting-agent
- ✅ Step 7: Save to specific outputs/ location

**Can move to skill:** Step 2 content generation
**Must stay in workflow:** Steps 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 (all orchestration)

---

### Example: write-scripts Workflow

**Orchestration (can't move to skill):**
- ✅ Step 0: Load voice profile
- ✅ Step 1: Load idea card & validate platform/duration
- ❌ Step 2: Generate script ← SKILL DOES THIS!
- ✅ Step 3: Ask user for review
- ✅ Step 4: Add timing & visual direction (platform-specific)
- ✅ Step 5: Generate hook variants
- ✅ Step 6: Create handoff package with metadata
- ✅ Step 7: Save with specific naming

**Can move to skill:** Step 2 script generation
**Must stay in workflow:** Steps 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7

---

## Skills vs Workflows - The Distinction

### Skills Are "Onboarding Guides"

**From Anthropic:**
> "Building a skill for an agent is like putting together an onboarding guide for a new hire."

**What onboarding guides contain:**
- Knowledge (how to do the job)
- Procedures (step-by-step instructions)
- Tools (scripts to help)
- References (where to look for info)

**What onboarding guides DON'T contain:**
- State tracking (what step are we on?)
- Conditional decisions (if A then B else C)
- File organization (where to save what)
- User interaction (ask questions mid-process)

---

### Workflows Are "Process Managers"

**What managers do:**
- Coordinate multiple expert contributions
- Track state across multi-step processes
- Make decisions based on context
- Interact with stakeholders (users)
- Organize outputs
- Ensure quality checkpoints

**What managers DON'T do:**
- Know all the expertise themselves (they call experts!)
- Generate content directly (they delegate to skills!)

---

## Real-World Analogy

### Hiring a Writer

**With Skill Only:**
```
You: "Write a LinkedIn post about AI"
Writer (skill): Uses Justin Welsh formula, generates post
Result: Post text
```

**Problem:** Where does it get saved? What about voice? Idea card? Platform validation? Handoff to posting agent?

**With Workflow + Skill:**
```
You: "Write a LinkedIn post about AI"
Manager (workflow):
  1. "Do we have this person's voice profile?" (loads memories)
  2. "Is there an idea card for this?" (loads idea)
  3. "Writer, create the post" (calls post-writer skill)
  4. Writer generates using Justin Welsh formula
  5. Manager: "User, want to review this?"
  6. User approves
  7. Manager: "Format for LinkedIn" (platform logic)
  8. Manager: "Create variants for testing"
  9. Manager: "Save to outputs/linkedin-post-ai-2025-10-28.md"
  10. Manager: "Create handoff JSON for posting agent"
Result: Complete package ready for next step
```

**Workflow adds PROCESS to skill's EXPERTISE!**

## Cookbook Analysis

### What Cookbooks Show

**Notebook 1:** Basic skills usage
- Excel skill creates spreadsheet
- PowerPoint skill creates presentation
- PDF skill creates document

**Simple requests, simple outputs!**

**Notebook 2:** Financial applications
- Cross-format workflows: CSV → Excel → PowerPoint → PDF
- Multiple skills composed
- Token optimization

**Still simple: Claude decides which skills, generates outputs**

**Notebook 3:** Custom skills development
- Brand guidelines skill
- Financial analyzer skill
- Financial modeler skill

**All are EXPERTISE packages, not PROCESS orchestrators!**

---

### What Cookbooks DON'T Show

**Not in cookbooks:**
- Multi-step state management
- User interaction checkpoints
- Complex conditional logic
- Organized file outputs
- Handoff between different agents
- Workflow dependencies (Step 5 needs Step 2's output)

**Why:** Because skills aren't designed for that!

---

## The Architecture Decision

### Option 1: Skills Only (What You Suggested)

**Pros:**
- Simpler architecture
- Everything in .claude/skills/
- Automatic loading
- Composable

**Cons:**
- ❌ No state management
- ❌ No user interaction
- ❌ No file organization
- ❌ No multi-step orchestration
- ❌ No conditional logic
- ❌ No handoff packages
- ❌ Can't track "voice profile loaded in Step 0, use in Step 3"

**Result:** Would lose 80% of workflow functionality!

---

### Option 2: Workflows + Skills (Current)

**Pros:**
- ✅ Skills provide expertise
- ✅ Workflows orchestrate process
- ✅ State management works
- ✅ User interaction possible
- ✅ File organization maintained
- ✅ Handoff packages created
- ✅ Multi-step dependencies tracked

**Cons:**
- More complex architecture
- Two systems to maintain
- Need to understand both

**Result:** Full functionality preserved!

---

### Option 3: Thin Workflows + Rich Skills (RECOMMENDED)

**Move FROM workflows TO skills:**
- Content generation knowledge
- Creator methodologies
- Best practices
- Prompt templates

**Keep IN workflows:**
- Step orchestration
- State management
- User interaction
- File I/O
- Conditional logic
- Handoff creation

**Example refactor:**

**Before (workflow has knowledge):**
```xml
<step n="2">
  <action>Generate LinkedIn post using Justin Welsh PAIPS:
    - Problem: State challenge
    - Agitate: Amplify pain
    - Invalidate: Old solutions fail
    - Promise: New approach
    - Solve: Your solution
  </action>
</step>
```

**After (workflow calls skill):**
```xml
<step n="2">
  <action>Use post-writer skill (auto-loaded):
    Skill contains all creator methodologies.
    Generate LinkedIn post with loaded idea card and voice profile.
  </action>
</step>
```

**Knowledge moved to post-writer/SKILL.md, workflow just orchestrates!**

---

## Evidence Against Deprecation

### 1. Anthropic's Own Architecture

**From engineering blog:**
> "we hope to enable agents to create, edit, and evaluate Skills on their own"

**Note:** Even Anthropic's vision includes AGENTS (orchestrators) using skills!

They're not saying "skills replace agents" - they're saying "agents use skills"

**Our architecture:**
```
Agents → Workflows → Skills
```

**Anthropic's architecture:**
```
Agents → Skills
```

**Difference:** Our workflows ARE the agent orchestration layer!

---

### 2. Skills Cookbook Examples

**Every cookbook example is SIMPLE:**
- "Create an Excel spreadsheet" → xlsx skill → Done
- "Generate a presentation" → pptx skill → Done
- "Analyze financial data" → custom skill → Done

**No cookbook shows:**
- Load state from file
- Ask user mid-process
- Save to specific location
- Create handoff for next process
- Multi-step dependencies

**Because skills aren't designed for that!**

---

### 3. Real Workflow Complexity

**Your write-posts workflow does:**

```
1. Load voice profile (state from disk)
2. Load idea card (state from previous workflow)
3. Call skill for content generation ← ONLY THIS IS SKILL TERRITORY!
4. Ask user for review (interaction)
5. Platform-specific formatting (conditional logic)
6. Generate variants (additional processing)
7. Create handoff JSON (structured output)
8. Save to outputs/ (file organization)
```

**If we tried to put all this in a skill:**
- How would skill load previous state?
- How would skill ask user questions?
- How would skill know where to save outputs?
- How would skill create handoff for next agent?

**Answer:** Skills CAN'T do these things!

---

## What We SHOULD Do

### Refactor: Thin Workflows + Rich Skills

**Current state:**
- Workflows: 50% orchestration + 50% knowledge
- Skills: 100% knowledge

**Target state:**
- Workflows: 100% orchestration (THIN!)
- Skills: 100% knowledge (RICH!)

### Move TO Skills:

**Content generation patterns:**
- ✅ Justin Welsh formulas
- ✅ Ali Abdaal methodologies
- ✅ MrBeast psychology
- ✅ Platform algorithms
- ✅ Retention tactics
- ✅ Viral engagement data

**All "how to write good content" knowledge → SKILLS!**

---

### Keep IN Workflows:

**Process orchestration:**
- ✅ Load state (voice profile, idea cards)
- ✅ User interaction (ask questions, get confirmations)
- ✅ Conditional logic (if platform == X then Y)
- ✅ File I/O (save to specific locations)
- ✅ Template population (handoff JSONs)
- ✅ Step dependencies (Step 3 needs Step 1's output)
- ✅ Call multiple skills in sequence

**All "what to do when" logic → WORKFLOWS!**

---

## Example Refactor: write-posts Workflow

### Before (Knowledge in Workflow)

**Workflow contains:**
```xml
<step n="2">
  <action>Generate LinkedIn post:
    Use Justin Welsh PAIPS formula:
    - Problem: Identify core challenge
    - Agitate: Amplify pain point
    - Invalidate: Dismiss old solutions
    - Promise: Introduce new approach
    - Solve: Deliver solution

    Format:
    - Hook first 140 chars
    - Body 150-300 words
    - CTA question-based
    - Hashtags 3-5 relevant
  </action>
</step>
```

**Problem:** Knowledge duplicated in workflow AND skill!

---

### After (Knowledge Only in Skill)

**Workflow (THIN):**
```xml
<step n="2" goal="Generate content using post-writer skill">
  <note>post-writer skill auto-loads for social post tasks</note>

  <action>Apply post-writer skill:
    - Skill contains all creator methodologies (Justin Welsh, Greg Isenberg)
    - Pass context: idea_card, voice_profile, target_platform
    - Skill generates platform-optimized post
    - Returns formatted post text
  </action>

  <action>Store result: {generated_post}</action>
</step>
```

**Skill (RICH - already is!):**
```markdown
# post-writer Skill

## Justin Welsh PAIPS Formula
Problem → Agitate → Invalidate → Promise → Solve

## Justin Welsh Top 5 Format
Strategic ordering, withhold best until end

## Greg Isenberg Question Format
Hook with question, build curiosity

## deedydas Data-Driven
Stats-heavy, cite sources

## Platform Specifications
LinkedIn: 150-300 words, hook <140 chars, hashtags 3-5
Twitter: Long-form 500-2500 OR thread 7 tweets
Instagram: Caption 600-1200 chars, hashtags 5-10
```

**All knowledge in skill, workflow just calls it!**

---

## Benefits of Thin Workflows + Rich Skills

### 1. Skills Become Portable

**Rich skills can be:**
- Shared across teams
- Uploaded to Anthropic
- Used in multiple workflows
- Composed freely

**Example:** post-writer skill could be used by:
- write-posts workflow
- generate-ideas workflow (for caption drafts)
- competitive-analysis workflow (for comparison posts)
- ANY workflow needing social post generation!

---

### 2. Workflows Become Clearer

**Thin workflows:**
- Just orchestration logic
- Easier to understand
- Easier to debug
- Easier to modify

**Example:** Current write-posts is 639 lines (instruction + knowledge)
**After refactor:** Could be ~200 lines (just orchestration)

**Knowledge lives in auto-loaded skills!**

---

### 3. Better Separation of Concerns

**Current confusion:**
- "Is this workflow or skill?"
- "Why is knowledge duplicated?"
- "Which one updates when methodologies change?"

**After refactor:**
- Knowledge: Always in skills
- Process: Always in workflows
- Clear responsibility boundaries

---

## Recommended Architecture

### The Layers (Don't Collapse!)

```
Layer 1: Agents (Slash Commands)
  Purpose: User-facing entry points
  Location: .claude/commands/
  Example: /jarvis

Layer 2: Workflows (Process Orchestration)
  Purpose: Multi-step coordination, state, I/O
  Location: bmad/agents/*/workflows/
  Example: write-posts.yaml

Layer 3: Skills (Expert Knowledge)
  Purpose: Content generation, methodologies, tools
  Location: .claude/skills/
  Example: post-writer/SKILL.md
```

**All three layers needed!**

**But:** Workflows should be THINNER (less knowledge, more orchestration)

---

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Audit Current Workflows

**Identify knowledge currently in workflows:**
- Creator methodologies
- Platform specifications
- Best practices
- Content formulas
- Prompt templates

**Mark for extraction to skills**

---

### Phase 2: Enrich Skills

**Move knowledge from workflows to skills:**

**post-writer skill:** Already rich (has Justin Welsh, Greg Isenberg)
**video-script-writer skill:** Already rich (has Ali Abdaal, MKBHD)
**youtube-thumbnail-mastery:** Already rich (has MrBeast, Thomas Frank)

**Other skills may need enrichment:**
- voice-matcher: Add more voice extraction techniques
- platform-formatter: Add all platform specs from workflows
- research-synthesizer: Add research organization methodologies

---

### Phase 3: Thin Workflows

**Update workflows to just orchestrate:**

**Remove:** Creator methodology details
**Remove:** Best practice explanations
**Remove:** Platform specification details

**Keep:** Step sequence, state management, user interaction, file I/O

**Add:** Clear skill references with context passing

---

### Phase 4: Test & Iterate

**Verify:**
- Skills auto-load correctly
- Workflows reference skills properly
- Knowledge accessible when needed
- Nothing duplicated
- Full functionality preserved

---

## Concrete Example: Refactored Workflow

### Current write-posts Step 2 (199 lines!)

```xml
<step n="2" goal="Generate content using post-writer Skill">
  <action>Display: "Generating {target_platform} post using proven creator formulas..."</action>

  <action>**Determine post format:**

    Platform-based routing:
    - LinkedIn → LinkedIn post (<200 words, PAIPS or Top 5)
    - Twitter + single → Single tweet (<280 chars, Greg/Deedy patterns)
    - Twitter + thread → Thread (7 tweets, viral formula)
    - Twitter + longform → Long-form (500-2500 chars, article format)
    - Substack → Newsletter (800-1500 words, Paul Graham style)

    Style selection (based on content type):
    - List/tips → justin_welsh_top5 or top_5_list
    - Problem/solution → justin_welsh_paips
    - Story → storytelling or before_after_bridge
    - Data/analysis → data_driven or deedydas_data
    - Thought leadership → contrarian
  </action>

  <action>**Invoke post-writer Skill:**
    [139 more lines of detailed instructions...]
  </action>
</step>
```

**Total: 199 lines of mixed orchestration + knowledge!**

---

### Refactored (Thin - 25 lines!)

```xml
<step n="2" goal="Generate content using post-writer skill (model-invoked)">
  <note>post-writer skill auto-loads when Claude detects social post creation.
  Skill contains all creator methodologies (Justin Welsh, Greg Isenberg, etc.)</note>

  <action>Claude, use post-writer skill to generate content:

    **Context to pass to skill:**
    - Topic: {idea_card.title}
    - Platform: {target_platform}
    - Target audience: {audience}
    - Voice profile: {loaded_voice_profile}
    - Research data: {research_brief} (if available)

    **Skill will automatically:**
    - Select appropriate format (PAIPS, Top 5, thread, long-form)
    - Apply creator methodology
    - Match voice profile
    - Generate platform-optimized post

    Store result: {generated_post}
  </action>
</step>
```

**Knowledge in skill, workflow just coordinates!**

---

## Answer to Your Question

### "Should we deprecate workflows and move everything to skills?"

**NO - But workflows should be THINNER!**

**Why not deprecate:**
1. Skills can't manage state
2. Skills can't handle user interaction
3. Skills can't orchestrate multi-step processes
4. Skills can't do conditional logic
5. Skills can't organize file outputs

**What we SHOULD do:**
1. ✅ Move ALL knowledge TO skills
2. ✅ Make workflows pure orchestration
3. ✅ Clear separation of concerns
4. ✅ Skills become portable
5. ✅ Workflows become simpler

---

## The Critical Insight

### Skills = "How to Do the Job"

**From Anthropic:**
> "Building a skill for an agent is like putting together an onboarding guide for a new hire."

**Onboarding guide contains:**
- How we write code here
- What our brand guidelines are
- How to analyze data
- What methodologies we use

**Onboarding guide does NOT contain:**
- When to load previous state
- How to ask manager (user) for approval
- Where to save files
- What to do if condition X

**That's the PROCESS, not the EXPERTISE!**

---

### Workflows = "Managing the Work"

**What managers do:**
- Coordinate expert work (skills!)
- Track progress through multi-step process
- Check in with stakeholders (user interaction)
- Organize deliverables (file I/O)
- Make decisions (conditional logic)
- Ensure dependencies met (state management)

**This is ORCHESTRATION, not EXPERTISE!**

---

## Final Recommendation

### DON'T Deprecate Workflows

**Keep workflows for:**
1. State management (load voice, idea cards)
2. User interaction (questions, confirmations)
3. Conditional logic (platform routing)
4. File I/O (save to outputs/, handoff JSONs)
5. Multi-step orchestration
6. Process coordination

**These are NOT skill territory!**

---

### DO Refactor Workflows

**Make workflows THINNER:**
1. Remove knowledge details
2. Just reference skills
3. Pass context to skills
4. Orchestrate steps
5. Manage state and I/O

**Example target:**
- Current: 639 lines (write-posts)
- Target: ~200 lines (just orchestration)
- Knowledge: Moved to skills

---

### DO Enrich Skills

**Make skills RICHER:**
1. All creator methodologies
2. All platform algorithms
3. All best practices
4. All prompt templates
5. All executable helpers

**Skills become comprehensive expertise packages!**

---

## Action Plan

### Immediate (Do Now)

1. **Audit workflows** - Mark knowledge vs orchestration
2. **Extract knowledge** - Move to existing skills
3. **Test skills** - Verify auto-loading works
4. **Update workflow instructions** - Reference skills, don't duplicate knowledge

### Short-Term (This Week)

5. **Refactor write-posts** - Thin down to pure orchestration
6. **Refactor write-scripts** - Same treatment
7. **Verify functionality** - Nothing lost in refactor
8. **Update documentation** - Clear workflows vs skills roles

### Long-Term (Next Month)

9. **Create more skills** - LinkedIn, Twitter multi-source
10. **Share skills** - Upload to Anthropic for organization
11. **Build skill library** - Comprehensive expertise collection
12. **Simplify workflows** - Pure process coordination

## Conclusion

**Your intuition is PARTIALLY correct:**

✅ **YES** - Skills are extremely powerful
✅ **YES** - We should leverage them MORE
✅ **YES** - Workflows currently have too much knowledge

❌ **NO** - We shouldn't deprecate workflows
❌ **NO** - Skills can't replace orchestration
❌ **NO** - We'd lose critical functionality

**The answer:** **THIN WORKFLOWS + RICH SKILLS!**

**Not:** Skills only
**Not:** Current state (knowledge in both)
**Yes:** Clear separation (knowledge in skills, orchestration in workflows)

## Visual Summary

```
CURRENT STATE (Confused):
┌─────────────────────┐
│ Workflow            │
│ - 50% orchestration │
│ - 50% knowledge  ←──┼─── Duplicated!
└─────────────────────┘

┌─────────────────────┐
│ Skill               │
│ - 100% knowledge ───┼─── Duplicated!
└─────────────────────┘
```

```
IDEAL STATE (Clean):
┌─────────────────────┐
│ Workflow            │
│ - 100% orchestration│
│   • State           │
│   • Interaction     │
│   • Logic           │
│   • I/O             │
│ - Calls skills ─────┼──┐

```

**Zero duplication! Clear responsibilities!**

**Files analyzed:**
- ✅ docs/agent-skills/agent-skills.md (official docs)
- ✅ docs/agent-skills/equipping-agents-for-the-real-world-with-ahent-skills.md
- ✅ Anthropic cookbooks (GitHub)
- ✅ Current workflow implementations
- ✅ Current skill implementations

**Status:** Deep analysis complete

**Recommendation:** Keep workflows, make them thinner, enrich skills!
