# Learn-Voice Workflow - Fixed!

**Date:** 2025-10-27
**Status:** Streamlined and consistent

---

## What Was Fixed

### Problem:
The learn-voice workflow was asking users to choose between 3 options for Twitter:
1. Use Apify scraper (~$0.02)
2. Manual export (FREE but tedious)
3. Skip Twitter

This created unnecessary friction and confusion during the workflow.

### Solution: Smart Automatic Fallback

**NEW BEHAVIOR:**

#### Twitter (Automatic):
1. **Try mcp_twitter first** (FREE if available)
   - `mcp_twitter/get_last_tweet_from_user`
   - If succeeds: âœ“ Done (FREE)

2. **Fallback to Apify** (if mcp_twitter unavailable)
   - `apidojo/twitter-scraper-lite`
   - Cost: ~$0.02 for 50 tweets
   - Reliable and automatic

**No user intervention required!** âœ¨

#### LinkedIn (Already good):
- Uses `linkedin-mcp` first
- Falls back to Apify if needed
- Consistent pattern

#### YouTube (FREE):
- Uses `youtube_transcript/get_transcript`
- Analyzes spoken voice from video transcripts
- Completely free
