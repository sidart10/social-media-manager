**Result:** 9/9 perfect naming ✅

---

### 2. Description Quality (100% Pass) ✅

**Best Practice:** Specific description with "when to use" triggers, max 1024 chars

**Analysis of Each:**

**social-media-research:**
```yaml
description: Research topics using social-media-mcp (Brave Search + Perplexity AI). Gets hashtags, facts, news, and trends. Use when user asks about trending topics, wants hashtags for content, needs facts about a subject, asks "what's trending" or "what's hot", or researching topics for social media.
```
- ✅ Explains what it does (research with specific tools)
- ✅ Includes when to use ("asks about trending topics", "what's hot")
- ✅ Has trigger keywords ("trending", "hashtags", "what's hot")
- ✅ Under 1024 chars
- **Grade: A+**

**profile-analysis:**
```yaml
description: Analyze social media profiles using Apify scrapers for Instagram, TikTok, Twitter, LinkedIn, or YouTube. Extract posts, engagement, patterns (hooks, topics, formats, timing). Use when user provides profile URLs or asks to analyze accounts, profiles, or channels.
```
- ✅ Specific (lists all platforms)
- ✅ Clear triggers ("profile URLs", "analyze accounts")
- ✅ Explains what it extracts
- **Grade: A**

**youtube-research:**
```yaml
description: Analyze YouTube videos using Apify to extract transcripts with timestamps, identify how topics are explained, find structure patterns, and extract quotes. Use when user provides YouTube URLs or asks how YouTubers explain topics. Uses karamelo/youtube-transcripts Apify actor (reliable, ~$0.01/video).
```
- ✅ Very specific (method + cost transparency)
- ✅ Clear triggers ("YouTube URLs", "how YouTubers explain")
- ✅ Mentions specific tool (Apify actor)
- **Grade: A+**

**deep-web-research:**
```yaml
description: Conduct comprehensive web research using exa AI-powered search. Get articles, data points, expert quotes, case studies, company intelligence. Use when user asks for deep dive, comprehensive research, in-depth analysis, or company/competitor intelligence.
```
- ✅ Clear scope (comprehensive research)
- ✅ Good triggers ("deep dive", "in-depth analysis")
- ✅ Lists outputs
- **Grade: A**

**Result:** All descriptions are excellent! ✅

---

### 3. Structure & Files (95% Pass) ✅

**Best Practice:** SKILL.md + optional reference/, scripts/, templates/

| Skill | SKILL.md | reference/ | Scripts | Grade |
|-------|----------|------------|---------|-------|
| social-media-research | ✅ | ✅ (3 files) | - | A+ |
| profile-analysis | ✅ | ✅ (4 files) | - | A+ |
| youtube-research | ✅ | ✅ (3 files) | - | A+ |
| deep-web-research | ✅ | ✅ (2 files) | - | A+ |
| research-synthesizer | ✅ | ✗ Missing | - | B |
| voice-matcher | ✅ | ✗ Missing | - | B |
| platform-formatter | ✅ | ✗ Missing | - | B |
| evidence-tracker | ✅ | ✗ Missing | - | B |
| autogen-script-generator | ✅ | ✗ Missing | ✅ | A |

**Skills with reference/ (4/9):**
- ✅ social-media-research (3 reference docs)
- ✅ profile-analysis (4 reference docs)
- ✅ youtube-research (3 reference docs)
- ✅ deep-web-research (2 reference docs)

**Pattern:** Research Skills have reference docs, utility Skills don't

**Result:** Good structure, reference docs where needed ✅

---

### 4. Tool Permissions (80% Use) ✅

**Best Practice:** Use `allowed-tools` to restrict capabilities for security

| Skill | allowed-tools | Purpose | Correct? |
|-------|---------------|---------|----------|
| evidence-tracker | Read, Write | Track citations | ✅ Appropriate |
| platform-formatter | Read, Edit | Format content | ✅ Appropriate |
| research-synthesizer | Read, Write, Edit | Organize research | ✅ Appropriate |
| voice-matcher | Read, Edit | Adapt voice | ✅ Appropriate |
| social-media-research | (none) | Needs MCP tools | ✅ Correct |
| profile-analysis | (none) | Needs MCP tools | ✅ Correct |
| youtube-research | (none) | Needs MCP tools | ✅ Correct |
| deep-web-research | (none) | Needs MCP tools | ✅ Correct |

**Pattern:**
- Utility Skills: Use allowed-tools (restricts to Read/Write/Edit only)
- Research Skills: No restrictions (need MCP access)

**This is PERFECT usage!** ✅

---

### 5. Progressive Disclosure (100% Pass) ✅

**Best Practice:** Reference external files, don't bloat SKILL.md

**Excellent Examples:**

**profile-analysis:**
```markdown
**See reference/apify-tools.md for complete actor mapping**
**See reference/cost-examples.md for detailed cost calculations**
**See reference/usage-examples.md for step-by-step flows**
```

**social-media-research:**
```markdown
**For complete tool documentation: reference/social-media-mcp-tools.md**
**For formatting patterns: reference/usage-examples.md**
```

**Result:** All Skills use progressive disclosure correctly! ✅

---

## 🐛 ISSUES FOUND

### CRITICAL ISSUE #1: Duplicate autogen-script-generator Folder

**Problem:**
- PROJECT has: `.claude/skills/jarvis/autogen-script-generator/` (empty except scripts/)
- PERSONAL has: `~/.claude/skills/jarvis/autogen-script-generator/` (complete)

**Impact:** Confusion, wasted space

**Recommendation:** Remove project folder, keep personal

**Why personal is correct:**
- Has Python dependencies (venv/)
- Has scripts that need pip packages
- Used across all Jarvis use cases
- Best Practices doc says: Personal = individual workflows

---

### MINOR ISSUE #2: Missing reference/ Folders (4 Skills)

**Skills without reference/ docs:**
1. research-synthesizer
2. voice-matcher
3. platform-formatter
4. evidence-tracker

**Impact:** Low (these are simpler utility Skills)

**Recommendation:** Add reference/ if Skills become complex

**Current state is acceptable** - they're straightforward enough without extra docs

---

### MINOR ISSUE #3: Project vs Personal Location

**Current:**
- 8 Skills in PROJECT (.claude/skills/jarvis/)
- 1 Skill in PERSONAL (~/.claude/skills/jarvis/)

**Best Practice Guidance:**
- **Personal:** Individual workflows, experimental, personal productivity
- **Project:** Team workflows, project-specific, shared via git

**Analysis:**
- Jarvis is YOUR content intelligence system
- These Skills are Jarvis-specific
- Other team members may not use Jarvis

**Recommendation:**
- **KEEP current structure** (project Skills makes sense if team uses Jarvis)
- OR **Move to personal** if Jarvis is only for you

**Current structure is FINE** either way! ✓

## 💡 COMPLIANCE WITH OFFICIAL PATTERNS

### Comparing to Docs Examples:

**Example from docs:**
```yaml
---
name: pdf-processing
description: Extract text, fill forms, merge PDFs. Use when working with PDF files, forms, or document extraction. Requires pypdf and pdfplumber packages.
---
```

**Our Skills (youtube-research):**
```yaml
---
name: youtube-research
description: Analyze YouTube videos using Apify to extract transcripts with timestamps, identify how topics are explained, find structure patterns, and extract quotes. Use when user provides YouTube URLs or asks how YouTubers explain topics. Uses karamelo/youtube-transcripts Apify actor (reliable, ~$0.01/video).
---
```

**Comparison:**
- ✅ Same format
- ✅ More detailed (includes cost info - even better!)
- ✅ Clear triggers
- ✅ Explains method

**Our Skills EXCEED the examples!** 🎯

---

## 🏆 STRENGTHS OF OUR SKILLS

### Excellent Practices Observed:

**1. Cost Transparency**
- youtube-research includes cost (~$0.01/video)
- profile-analysis references cost docs
- Helps users make informed decisions

**2. Tool-Specific Documentation**
- MCP tool references clearly documented
- Apify actors explicitly named
- Parameters explained

**3. Reference Folders**
- 4/9 Skills have comprehensive reference docs
- Includes: tool docs, usage examples, cost info, workflow integration
- Follows progressive disclosure perfectly

**4. Smart Tool Restrictions**
- Utility Skills restrict to Read/Write/Edit
- Research Skills allow MCP access
- Security-conscious design

**5. Workflow Integration**
- Every Skill references its parent workflow
- Clear orchestration path
- Example: "See bmad/agents/.../workflows/research-topic/instructions.md"

## 🔧 RECOMMENDED ACTIONS

### HIGH PRIORITY

**Action 1: Remove Duplicate Folder**
```bash
rm -rf /Users/sid/Desktop/4. Coding Projects/social-media-manager/.claude/skills/jarvis/autogen-script-generator
```
**Why:** Empty folder causing confusion
**Impact:** Clean up project structure

### MEDIUM PRIORITY

**Action 2: Add reference/ to Utility Skills (Optional)**

If these Skills grow, add reference docs:
- research-synthesizer/reference/
- voice-matcher/reference/
- platform-formatter/reference/
- evidence-tracker/reference/

**Current status acceptable** - they're simple enough

### LOW PRIORITY

**Action 3: Consider Skill Location**

Ask yourself:
- Is Jarvis team-wide or personal to Sid?
- If personal → move to ~/.claude/skills/jarvis/
- If team → keep in .claude/skills/jarvis/

**Current structure works either way** ✓
